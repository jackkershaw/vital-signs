              We are a bunch of people who work in and around the
              health sector and are in the early stages of getting a
              network together. Our main aim is to understand and
              support the struggles in our sector. Weâ€™re from different
              backgrounds in terms of work and organising, but share a
              perspective that in the end it is about working class
              control over the means for a healthy life, and that
              worker and patient control of healthcare is a step
              towards that. If you are interested, come to our next
              meeting, contact us at:
              healthworkersunited@protonmail.com If you want to keep
