strikes of 2021</h1></div></div></div></div><div class="max-w-2xl mx-auto"><div class="post-body_content__ye_eq"><p><em>The strike in the state-owned Berlin hospitals 2021 will go down in the history of the hospital movement for its length of more than 30 days alone. It was also remarkable that the focus was not on wage levels but on the catastrophic staffing situation in the hospitals. For the first time, the workers of the two largest hospital operators Vivantes and Charité went on strike together for a relief collective agreement (addressing primarily the staff – patient ratio) and the application of the collective agreement for the public service (TVÖD) in the Vivantes subsidiaries. Ver.di, with dozens of organisers, set up different structures during the strike to motivate individual workers and actively involve them in the strike action. The result of the collective agreement was hailed from many sides. According to ver.di negotiator Melanie Guba, a “milestone of relief” was to be set with the collective agreement at the Charité. In contrast to previous collective agreements, the colleagues succeeded above all in obtaining either financial compensation or additional days off to compensate for the strain of understaffed shifts.</em></p>
<p><em>What is the current situation on the wards? And what has remained of the dynamics of the strike for the workers? We talked about this with a nurse who has been employed at the Charité for over twenty years and has worked on various wards.</em></p>
<p><em>A great documentary on recent health workers strikes in Germany can be found on <a href="https://de.labournet.tv/hoechstens-vier-wochen">Labournet.tv</a>, unfortunately without English subtitles.</em></p>
<p>***</p>
<p><em>More than a year after the strike, what do things look like at work? Has the staff situation on individual wards really improved and has the agreement been implemented?</em></p>
<p>There are definitely areas where the situation has improved. However, we also hear quite often that, as many of us expected, nothing has really improved in terms of relief through more staff in this quite short time. Recently, the press has mainly reported on the situation in the paediatric wards, because there, too, the agreed staff-to-patient ratio was implemented in almost none of the shifts. Colleagues in oncology, for example, report that about half of the beds have been closed in order to keep the ratio. Currently, colleagues from other countries are being recruited on a massive scale, which in turn brings its own problems and often leads to a different workload on the wards. Despite its locational advantage (attractive location, size), the Charité manages at best to compensate for the high turnover of nursing staff by recruiting new staff, but is not in a position to build up staff significantly. Nevertheless, the collective agreement should be seen as a certain relief. Previously, colleagues were usually told by their superiors that they had to organise themselves better, for example, when they indicated in a hazard report (Datix) that they felt overworked. This was simply dismissed as a subjective feeling. You don’t have to listen to that kind of nonsense anymore with the ratios that are automatically recorded. In addition, there are these ChEP points (Charité relief points). If the staff-patient ratio agreed in the collective agreement is not reached in a shift, the colleagues concerned each receive a ChEP. These, in turn, can be converted into days off to a limited extent or saved up. In this respect, what has been agreed is being implemented at the Charité. The commission that is supposed to determine staffing rules for areas not yet covered by the collective agreement is also working regularly. As far as we hear from the colleagues at Vivantes, they are experiencing far greater disappointments.</p>
<p><em>Is it realistic that colleagues can really take their time off when they have accumulated the corresponding stress points, or does it only exist on paper?</em></p>
<p>The Charité, wisely anticipating that many such relief days would arise, had it written into the collective agreement that their number would be limited. Thus, in 2022 only five relief days per registered or qualified staff could be claimed; in 2023 it is to be ten and in 2024 then fifteen. The ChEPs accrued over and above this can either be saved for a sabbatical, which lasts a maximum of three months, or for the colleagues to escape to retirement a few weeks earlier, subject to some bureaucratic requirements. To a degree limited by tax law, it is also possible to convert ChEPs into money. Personally, I do not find any of the latter options attractive. In these alternatives, unfortunately, the danger is inherent that superiors will be in your ear to save up points rather than convert them into days off. A certain amount of steadfastness is needed to enforce the days off. In order to counteract the pressure on staff that is intensified by this system, the Charité asks the nursing staff to work additional so-called ‘stability shifts’. Because they are very well paid, many colleagues actually do these shifts. This in turn leads to more disputes on the wards among colleagues. Many find it scandalous that work in additional shifts is suddenly supposed to be worth much more, and expect colleagues on stability duty to work more. On the other hand, it is always a point of contention whether, after having worked their additional stability shift, the colleagues are much more exhausted once they are back on their own ward. In addition to the additional duties, the Charité is thinking aloud about making working hours more flexible, such as extending shifts to twelve hours. Even more blatant is the attempt to get nursing staff who have found a job within the Charité that is no longer directly at the patient’s bedside to return to normal ward duty. They talk about demographic-friendly jobs, but they absolutely want to bring colleagues back into patient care who have found their niche with less physically demanding activities and without shift work for health or private reasons. The demand from the board of the Charité to more or less directly ban agency work in nursing also fits in with this. Because in nursing, temporary employment agencies often offer better working conditions and pay more. What the whole thing is supposed to have to do with relief remains a mystery. Moreover, the Charité can of course determine how many patients it admits for treatment. This is what is meant by the bed closures just mentioned, but there are of course limits to this, since the Charité is supposed to be profitable and closing beds is disadvantageous for patients, some of whom have to put up with longer waiting times. In this respect, it is not realistic to grant additional days off if the clinic wants to offer a similar service level. This would require an additional workload through the back door, especially in the form of stability shifts. Nevertheless, the days off are important as a kind of compensation for pain and suffering.</p>
<p><em>You mentioned earlier that there are problems when colleagues are recruited from abroad. What does that mean exactly?</em></p>
<p>For one thing, I think it’s a disgrace when rich Germany poaches trained professionals in nursing, especially since I assume that the guidelines set out in the UN are hardly ever adhered to. After all, nursing staff are not only recruited for German patients through state agreements, but clinics also do this on their own. The colleagues bring different language skills with them and have worked in other care models with a correspondingly different division of labour. This leads to misunderstandings time and again. They need training for quite a long time and have to improve their language skills alongside their work. In any case, it takes some time before the new colleagues are actually perceived as a relief.</p>
<p><em>As you already mentioned, the collective agreements at Charité and Vivantes have been implemented very differently. What are the main differences?</em></p>
<p>The collective agreements contain rather complicated regulations, some of which revolve around the fact that a software program automatically compares patient occupancy and the staff assigned to a ward. This software actually worked at the Charité at the start of the collective agreement. The management of the state-owned Vivantes group wanted to be particularly precise and introduce a system that recorded the ratio to the minute. One consequence was that no recording system existed at all until the summer of 2022. On the other hand, the minute-by-minute accounting ensured that in the times of handover, when, for example, the early duty nurses and the colleagues from the late duty are together on the ward, the ratios are suddenly fulfilled, but the colleagues start their actual work again a short time later clearly understaffed. Colleagues from Vivantes report that they are transferred at short notice from a regularly staffed shift to other wards in order to at least partially compensate for the shortage there. The areas specified in the collective agreement for which there were no ratios when the collective agreement on relief (TVE) was signed (for example, radiology and dialysis) are still being negotiated at Charité, but at Vivantes there seems to be a real standstill. The management of Vivantes is behaving like real arseholes towards the nursing staff, but compared to the way they treat the colleagues in the subsidiaries, it seems almost friendly.</p>
<p><em>Both permanent staff and workers from the subsidiaries took industrial action together, but at the Vivantes subsidiaries the demand for a TVÖD (being paid like in the public sector) was in the foreground. According to the press, colleagues there are now voting with their feet en masse and quitting in the knowledge that they would earn more elsewhere. How do you assess the course of the very slow negotiations?</em></p>
<p>The strike ended with a collective agreement for the subsidiaries that is based on the TVÖD and provides for gradual wage increases, but does not reach the wage level of the TVÖD. Moreover, not all subsidiaries are treated equally. But since the agreement Vivantes has been arguing with ver.di and withholding larger parts of their wages from the colleagues who are supposedly so valuable to them. Some bonuses have been cancelled without replacement. In addition, Vivantes is haggling over the wage grades and job evaluations. From the colleagues’ point of view, they are to be placed in wage groups that are too low. Apparently, Vivantes is also cancelling previously granted bonuses with the new grouping, for example in the area of cleaning. At the same time, Vivantes wants to divide the colleagues and is planning to put new staff in a lower group. As far as I know, the drama was not over by the end of 2022. This could well be Vivantes’ calculation, because without an agreement with ver.di, each colleague will have to sue for their rights individually.</p>
<p><em>Would the strike have had to last longer to get the workers back into the parent company?</em></p>
<p>The strike should definitely have been longer. Both the goals of relief and the introduction of the TVÖD for the subsidiaries had not yet been securely achieved. Nevertheless, it has to be said that the nursing staff were on strike for four weeks and the colleagues in the subsidiaries for another two weeks. That is quite exhausting. In addition, there was a collection to financially support the strikers at the subsidiaries, but of course the strike money does not completely compensate for the wages. Especially those who don’t have much in terms of reserves and savings have to think about how long a strike can last. My feeling was that, before the Charité signed the collective agreement, the strength of the colleagues would probably have been enough for a few more days of strikes, but with the signature the end was sealed. Whether the time would have been enough to negotiate a better collective agreement remains speculative. However, the colleagues apparently felt that not much more was possible and voted accordingly to suspend the strike.</p>
<p><em>Is leaving the job currently the only form of protest? To what extent can these difficulties in implementation be used to push the struggles further?</em></p>
<p>Yes, at the moment the protest is mainly expressed in the fact that the (often female) colleagues are leaving the subsidiaries. Since the collective agreement is based on the TVÖD, there is the possibility of taking joint industrial action again in the current round of collective bargaining, focusing on the issue of wage levels. Unfortunately, the collective agreements are drafted in such a way that the agreed wage increases would only ever reach the colleagues of the subsidiaries with a time lag. Nevertheless, my hope would be that this year’s round of collective bargaining will once again bring us together in large numbers on the streets and on strike, so that the common ground is not so quickly forgotten. Because for almost twenty years, politics and bosses have divided us nicely.</p>
<p><em>In recent years, Ver.di has tried very hard to have a different form of member participation in the collective bargaining disputes. The keyword here is ‘strike university’ in the form of workshops for exchange and political discussions. Delegates and so-called ‘collective bargaining advisors’ (also a kind of team delegate) are appointed by the teams to accompany negotiations, they inform their teams and, in the best case, pass on the teams’ demands to ver.di. What do the colleagues think about the organisation of the strike and what has changed for them in the longer term as a result?</em></p>
<p>Up until the collective bargaining movement, the union approached us with a top-down style, i.e. union officials set targets and the pace. With the collective bargaining advisors, a path was taken in which the active colleagues can get much more involved. This has actually led to a certain (participatory) dynamic in the wards. Ideally, the bargaining advisors were elected by their teams and the teams discussed the matter. In 2021, this went so far that the team delegates, as the former bargaining advisers are now called, accompanied the negotiations very closely and were continuously informed by the bargaining commission. I have the impression that this was perceived as a good thing by many and led to sustained activity on their own part. In preparation for the collective bargaining, many are more interested than usual and take part in meetings, even if not yet at the level of 2021. In this respect, something like a team delegate structure definitely makes sense. However, whether such a structure is sufficient to actively challenge decisions made by union officials cannot yet be judged conclusively. Moreover, I think it is normal that the structures that emerge in an industrial dispute crumble again afterwards. That was probably the case at the Charité.</p>
<p><em>How did the colleagues experience the organisers and what remained of the dynamic that was created by them?</em></p>
<p>Without the organisers, the strike would not have happened. Especially in the beginning they were necessary to activate the colleagues. They gained a position of trust, if only because they were always around and approachable. At the same time, the official organisers planned large parts of the campaign, including the election of team delegates, the big meetings, demonstrations, etc. All very important for the momentum to build up a campaign. All very important for the dynamics of tackling such a long strike. But in my eyes this has also meant that the team delegates have too rarely questioned decisions and proposed arrangements. In my opinion, it would have been better if the organisers had withdrawn a bit more after the initial phase, especially in questions of content, in order to give the colleagues more room for their own development. Strikes must emancipate. Organisers are employees of a company commissioned by ver.di. This means that there is always a danger that the bureaucratic levels of ver.di will exert a strong influence on the opinions of the colleagues through the organisers. When the organisers express opinions, they usually carry more weight than when a nurse speaks. Colleagues are not used to questioning things and often prefer to stay in the consumer role, at least in my experience. The team delegates are a good idea to break this up, but it hasn’t quite happened yet.</p>
<p><em>Were there, or are there, attempts among the workers to organise independently beyond the trade union apparatus?</em></p>
<p>I would say that there are very few such attempts nationwide. All the groups I know of are made up of very few people. This seems to me to be an expression of the problem I have just described.</p>
<p><em>In the meantime, workers in more than twenty clinics nationwide have won collective agreements to reduce the workload. Do you have contacts in other cities and how are you networked?</em></p>
<p>Yes, there are contacts. Networking is mainly done through ver.di or also through supporting groups outside the clinics such as the alliance “Health not Profits”. These contacts can certainly be expanded.</p>
<p><em>How do you assess the strike support from the Berlin population and what would you wish for future disputes?</em></p>
<p>Actually, we had the feeling that we had a very broad support within the Berlin population. That means, on the one hand, meetings with the so-called ‘city society’, in which a lot of people and also initiatives took part. At the same time, we have also received a lot of positive feedback and support from family, friends, patients and relatives. The last collective dispute was about relief and thus also about improving patient care. And everyone knows that they can quickly become a patient. In 2023, it is now about our wage level and an inflation adjustment. We know that many Berliners are in a similar or even worse financial situation than we are. That’s why we don’t want our wage demands to be seen as greedy. For us, they are the absolute minimum wage increase for all workers and aid recipients. We hope that there will be powerful joint actions, for example with the colleagues at the Berlin municipal cleaning service, to push through our demands, and that the Berlin population will also take to the streets with us.</p>
<p><em>In October 2022, the doctors at the Charité also went on strike. What were the connections to the relief movement for better staffing ratios and what about the solidarity between different professional groups?</em></p>
<p>The doctors at the Charité have their own collective agreement through the Marburger Bund. In principle, the relationship between doctors and nurses is difficult as far as collective bargaining is concerned. On the one hand, due to the observation that the wage demands of the doctors’ colleagues have been met in recent years even without industrial action à la “doctors don’t have to strike”. On the other hand, during our strike for better staffing ratios, many a chief physician or senior physician attracted negative attention by putting pressure on the nursing staff to perform better than was possible due to the strike emergency staffing. Last year, the doctors demanded not only more pay but above all better working conditions, and here we would actually have an overlap, because both their and our working conditions are so unbearable because of the flat rates per case-system (hospitals receive a fixed amount for each individual treatment, which is supposed to motivate them to do it as efficient as possible). There is a lot of understanding on the part of the nursing staff for the demands of the assistant doctors, but unfortunately this is rarely expressed in actual solidarity among the individual nursing staff. At the same time, it has to be said that the solidarity among the occupational groups that maintain a clinic could, on the whole, be better.</p>
<p><em>What do you expect for the upcoming collective bargaining dispute as far as the motivation of your colleagues is concerned?</em></p>
<p>The pressure is very high because of the increased cost of living, so I hope that the colleagues are properly motivated. However, there are already fears among the colleagues that the bargaining committee will be satisfied with too little or that the employers will take refuge in arbitration. In contrast to the collective bargaining relief movement, this is now a nationwide collective agreement and experience shows that there is less direct influence from the ward-floors. This could also have a negative effect on the motivation of the colleagues. We will have to wait and see. The next strike day is on 9 February. Many colleagues have already made it clear that they want to take to the streets for their demands.</p>

strike in the state-owned Berlin hospitals 2021 will go down in the history of the hospital movement for its length of more than 30 days alone. It was also remarkable that the focus was not on wage levels but on the catastrophic staffing situation in the hospitals. For the first time, the workers of the two largest hospital operators Vivantes and Charité went on strike together for a relief collective agreement (addressing primarily the staff – patient ratio) and the application of the collective agreement for the public service (TVÖD) in the Vivantes subsidiaries. Ver.di, with dozens of organisers, set up different structures during the strike to motivate individual workers and actively involve them in the strike action. The result of the collective agreement was hailed from many sides. According to ver.di negotiator Melanie Guba, a “milestone of relief” was to be set with the collective agreement at the Charité. In contrast to previous collective agreements, the colleagues succeeded above all in obtaining either financial compensation or additional days off to compensate for the strain of understaffed shifts.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat is the current situation on the wards? And what has remained of the dynamics of the strike for the workers? We talked about this with a nurse who has been employed at the Charité for over twenty years and has worked on various wards.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eA great documentary on recent health workers strikes in Germany can be found on \u003ca href=\"https://de.labournet.tv/hoechstens-vier-wochen\"\u003eLabournet.tv\u003c/a\u003e, unfortunately without English subtitles.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e***\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eMore than a year after the strike, what do things look like at work? Has the staff situation on individual wards really improved and has the agreement been implemented?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are definitely areas where the situation has improved. However, we also hear quite often that, as many of us expected, nothing has really improved in terms of relief through more staff in this quite short time. Recently, the press has mainly reported on the situation in the paediatric wards, because there, too, the agreed staff-to-patient ratio was implemented in almost none of the shifts. Colleagues in oncology, for example, report that about half of the beds have been closed in order to keep the ratio. Currently, colleagues from other countries are being recruited on a massive scale, which in turn brings its own problems and often leads to a different workload on the wards. Despite its locational advantage (attractive location, size), the Charité manages at best to compensate for the high turnover of nursing staff by recruiting new staff, but is not in a position to build up staff significantly. Nevertheless, the collective agreement should be seen as a certain relief. Previously, colleagues were usually told by their superiors that they had to organise themselves better, for example, when they indicated in a hazard report (Datix) that they felt overworked. This was simply dismissed as a subjective feeling. You don’t have to listen to that kind of nonsense anymore with the ratios that are automatically recorded. In addition, there are these ChEP points (Charité relief points). If the staff-patient ratio agreed in the collective agreement is not reached in a shift, the colleagues concerned each receive a ChEP. These, in turn, can be converted into days off to a limited extent or saved up. In this respect, what has been agreed is being implemented at the Charité. The commission that is supposed to determine staffing rules for areas not yet covered by the collective agreement is also working regularly. As far as we hear from the colleagues at Vivantes, they are experiencing far greater disappointments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eIs it realistic that colleagues can really take their time off when they have accumulated the corresponding stress points, or does it only exist on paper?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Charité, wisely anticipating that many such relief days would arise, had it written into the collective agreement that their number would be limited. Thus, in 2022 only five relief days per registered or qualified staff could be claimed; in 2023 it is to be ten and in 2024 then fifteen. The ChEPs accrued over and above this can either be saved for a sabbatical, which lasts a maximum of three months, or for the colleagues to escape to retirement a few weeks earlier, subject to some bureaucratic requirements. To a degree limited by tax law, it is also possible to convert ChEPs into money. Personally, I do not find any of the latter options attractive. In these alternatives, unfortunately, the danger is inherent that superiors will be in your ear to save up points rather than convert them into days off. A certain amount of steadfastness is needed to enforce the days off. In order to counteract the pressure on staff that is intensified by this system, the Charité asks the nursing staff to work additional so-called ‘stability shifts’. Because they are very well paid, many colleagues actually do these shifts. This in turn leads to more disputes on the wards among colleagues. Many find it scandalous that work in additional shifts is suddenly supposed to be worth much more, and expect colleagues on stability duty to work more. On the other hand, it is always a point of contention whether, after having worked their additional stability shift, the colleagues are much more exhausted once they are back on their own ward. In addition to the additional duties, the Charité is thinking aloud about making working hours more flexible, such as extending shifts to twelve hours. Even more blatant is the attempt to get nursing staff who have found a job within the Charité that is no longer directly at the patient’s bedside to return to normal ward duty. They talk about demographic-friendly jobs, but they absolutely want to bring colleagues back into patient care who have found their niche with less physically demanding activities and without shift work for health or private reasons. The demand from the board of the Charité to more or less directly ban agency work in nursing also fits in with this. Because in nursing, temporary employment agencies often offer better working conditions and pay more. What the whole thing is supposed to have to do with relief remains a mystery. Moreover, the Charité can of course determine how many patients it admits for treatment. This is what is meant by the bed closures just mentioned, but there are of course limits to this, since the Charité is supposed to be profitable and closing beds is disadvantageous for patients, some of whom have to put up with longer waiting times. In this respect, it is not realistic to grant additional days off if the clinic wants to offer a similar service level. This would require an additional workload through the back door, especially in the form of stability shifts. Nevertheless, the days off are important as a kind of compensation for pain and suffering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eYou mentioned earlier that there are problems when colleagues are recruited from abroad. What does that mean exactly?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor one thing, I think it’s a disgrace when rich Germany poaches trained professionals in nursing, especially since I assume that the guidelines set out in the UN are hardly ever adhered to. After all, nursing staff are not only recruited for German patients through state agreements, but clinics also do this on their own. The colleagues bring different language skills with them and have worked in other care models with a correspondingly different division of labour. This leads to misunderstandings time and again. They need training for quite a long time and have to improve their language skills alongside their work. In any case, it takes some time before the new colleagues are actually perceived as a relief.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eAs you already mentioned, the collective agreements at Charité and Vivantes have been implemented very differently. What are the main differences?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe collective agreements contain rather complicated regulations, some of which revolve around the fact that a software program automatically compares patient occupancy and the staff assigned to a ward. This software actually worked at the Charité at the start of the collective agreement. The management of the state-owned Vivantes group wanted to be particularly precise and introduce a system that recorded the ratio to the minute. One consequence was that no recording system existed at all until the summer of 2022. On the other hand, the minute-by-minute accounting ensured that in the times of handover, when, for example, the early duty nurses and the colleagues from the late duty are together on the ward, the ratios are suddenly fulfilled, but the colleagues start their actual work again a short time later clearly understaffed. Colleagues from Vivantes report that they are transferred at short notice from a regularly staffed shift to other wards in order to at least partially compensate for the shortage there. The areas specified in the collective agreement for which there were no ratios when the collective agreement on relief (TVE) was signed (for example, radiology and dialysis) are still being negotiated at Charité, but at Vivantes there seems to be a real standstill. The management of Vivantes is behaving like real arseholes towards the nursing staff, but compared to the way they treat the colleagues in the subsidiaries, it seems almost friendly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eBoth permanent staff and workers from the subsidiaries took industrial action together, but at the Vivantes subsidiaries the demand for a TVÖD (being paid like in the public sector) was in the foreground. According to the press, colleagues there are now voting with their feet en masse and quitting in the knowledge that they would earn more elsewhere. How do you assess the course of the very slow negotiations?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe strike ended with a collective agreement for the subsidiaries that is based on the TVÖD and provides for gradual wage increases, but does not reach the wage level of the TVÖD. Moreover, not all subsidiaries are treated equally. But since the agreement Vivantes has been arguing with ver.di and withholding larger parts of their wages from the colleagues who are supposedly so valuable to them. Some bonuses have been cancelled without replacement. In addition, Vivantes is haggling over the wage grades and job evaluations. From the colleagues’ point of view, they are to be placed in wage groups that are too low. Apparently, Vivantes is also cancelling previously granted bonuses with the new grouping, for example in the area of cleaning. At the same time, Vivantes wants to divide the colleagues and is planning to put new staff in a lower group. As far as I know, the drama was not over by the end of 2022. This could well be Vivantes’ calculation, because without an agreement with ver.di, each colleague will have to sue for their rights individually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eWould the strike have had to last longer to get the workers back into the parent company?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe strike should definitely have been longer. Both the goals of relief and the introduction of the TVÖD for the subsidiaries had not yet been securely achieved. Nevertheless, it has to be said that the nursing staff were on strike for four weeks and the colleagues in the subsidiaries for another two weeks. That is quite exhausting. In addition, there was a collection to financially support the strikers at the subsidiaries, but of course the strike money does not completely compensate for the wages. Especially those who don’t have much in terms of reserves and savings have to think about how long a strike can last. My feeling was that, before the Charité signed the collective agreement, the strength of the colleagues would probably have been enough for a few more days of strikes, but with the signature the end was sealed. Whether the time would have been enough to negotiate a better collective agreement remains speculative. However, the colleagues apparently felt that not much more was possible and voted accordingly to suspend the strike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eIs leaving the job currently the only form of protest? To what extent can these difficulties in implementation be used to push the struggles further?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, at the moment the protest is mainly expressed in the fact that the (often female) colleagues are leaving the subsidiaries. Since the collective agreement is based on the TVÖD, there is the possibility of taking joint industrial action again in the current round of collective bargaining, focusing on the issue of wage levels. Unfortunately, the collective agreements are drafted in such a way that the agreed wage increases would only ever reach the colleagues of the subsidiaries with a time lag. Nevertheless, my hope would be that this year’s round of collective bargaining will once again bring us together in large numbers on the streets and on strike, so that the common ground is not so quickly forgotten. Because for almost twenty years, politics and bosses have divided us nicely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eIn recent years, Ver.di has tried very hard to have a different form of member participation in the collective bargaining disputes. The keyword here is ‘strike university’ in the form of workshops for exchange and political discussions. Delegates and so-called ‘collective bargaining advisors’ (also a kind of team delegate) are appointed by the teams to accompany negotiations, they inform their teams and, in the best case, pass on the teams’ demands to ver.di. What do the colleagues think about the organisation of the strike and what has changed for them in the longer term as a result?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUp until the collective bargaining movement, the union approached us with a top-down style, i.e. union officials set targets and the pace. With the collective bargaining advisors, a path was taken in which the active colleagues can get much more involved. This has actually led to a certain (participatory) dynamic in the wards. Ideally, the bargaining advisors were elected by their teams and the teams discussed the matter. In 2021, this went so far that the team delegates, as the former bargaining advisers are now called, accompanied the negotiations very closely and were continuously informed by the bargaining commission. I have the impression that this was perceived as a good thing by many and led to sustained activity on their own part. In preparation for the collective bargaining, many are more interested than usual and take part in meetings, even if not yet at the level of 2021. In this respect, something like a team delegate structure definitely makes sense. However, whether such a structure is sufficient to actively challenge decisions made by union officials cannot yet be judged conclusively. Moreover, I think it is normal that the structures that emerge in an industrial dispute crumble again afterwards. That was probably the case at the Charité.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eHow did the colleagues experience the organisers and what remained of the dynamic that was created by them?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout the organisers, the strike would not have happened. Especially in the beginning they were necessary to activate the colleagues. They gained a position of trust, if only because they were always around and approachable. At the same time, the official organisers planned large parts of the campaign, including the election of team delegates, the big meetings, demonstrations, etc. All very important for the momentum to build up a campaign. All very important for the dynamics of tackling such a long strike. But in my eyes this has also meant that the team delegates have too rarely questioned decisions and proposed arrangements. In my opinion, it would have been better if the organisers had withdrawn a bit more after the initial phase, especially in questions of content, in order to give the colleagues more room for their own development. Strikes must emancipate. Organisers are employees of a company commissioned by ver.di. This means that there is always a danger that the bureaucratic levels of ver.di will exert a strong influence on the opinions of the colleagues through the organisers. When the organisers express opinions, they usually carry more weight than when a nurse speaks. Colleagues are not used to questioning things and often prefer to stay in the consumer role, at least in my experience. The team delegates are a good idea to break this up, but it hasn’t quite happened yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eWere there, or are there, attempts among the workers to organise independently beyond the trade union apparatus?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would say that there are very few such attempts nationwide. All the groups I know of are made up of very few people. This seems to me to be an expression of the problem I have just described.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eIn the meantime, workers in more than twenty clinics nationwide have won collective agreements to reduce the workload. Do you have contacts in other cities and how are you networked?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, there are contacts. Networking is mainly done through ver.di or also through supporting groups outside the clinics such as the alliance “Health not Profits”. These contacts can certainly be expanded.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eHow do you assess the strike support from the Berlin population and what would you wish for future disputes?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eActually, we had the feeling that we had a very broad support within the Berlin population. That means, on the one hand, meetings with the so-called ‘city society’, in which a lot of people and also initiatives took part. At the same time, we have also received a lot of positive feedback and support from family, friends, patients and relatives. The last collective dispute was about relief and thus also about improving patient care. And everyone knows that they can quickly become a patient. In 2023, it is now about our wage level and an inflation adjustment. We know that many Berliners are in a similar or even worse financial situation than we are. That’s why we don’t want our wage demands to be seen as greedy. For us, they are the absolute minimum wage increase for all workers and aid recipients. We hope that there will be powerful joint actions, for example with the colleagues at the Berlin municipal cleaning service, to push through our demands, and that the Berlin population will also take to the streets with us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eIn October 2022, the doctors at the Charité also went on strike. What were the connections to the relief movement for better staffing ratios and what about the solidarity between different professional groups?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe doctors at the Charité have their own collective agreement through the Marburger Bund. In principle, the relationship between doctors and nurses is difficult as far as collective bargaining is concerned. On the one hand, due to the observation that the wage demands of the doctors’ colleagues have been met in recent years even without industrial action à la “doctors don’t have to strike”. On the other hand, during our strike for better staffing ratios, many a chief physician or senior physician attracted negative attention by putting pressure on the nursing staff to perform better than was possible due to the strike emergency staffing. Last year, the doctors demanded not only more pay but above all better working conditions, and here we would actually have an overlap, because both their and our working conditions are so unbearable because of the flat rates per case-system (hospitals receive a fixed amount for each individual treatment, which is supposed to motivate them to do it as efficient as possible). There is a lot of understanding on the part of the nursing staff for the demands of the assistant doctors, but unfortunately this is rarely expressed in actual solidarity among the individual nursing staff. At the same time, it has to be said that the solidarity among the occupational groups that maintain a clinic could, on the whole, be better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat do you expect for the upcoming collective bargaining dispute as far as the motivation of your colleagues is concerned?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pressure is very high because of the increased cost of living, so I hope that the colleagues are properly motivated. However, there are already fears among the colleagues that the bargaining committee will be satisfied with too little or that the employers will take refuge in arbitration. In contrast to the collective bargaining relief movement, this is now a nationwide collective agreement and experience shows that there is less direct influence from the ward-floors. This could also have a negative effect on the motivation of the colleagues. We will have to wait and see. The next strike day is on 9 February. Many colleagues have already made it clear that they want to take to the streets for their demands.\u003c/p\u003e\n"},"posts":{"edges":[{"node":{"title":"Speech by an apprentice health worker at the ‘Walk of Care’ in Berlin","excerpt":"\u003cp\u003eWe document a speech by an apprentice care worker held at a recent \u0026#8216;Walk of Care\u0026#8217; in Berlin.\u003c/p\u003e\n","slug":"speech-by-an-apprentice-health-worker-at-the-walk-of-care-in-berlin","date":"2024-06-04T08:56:27","featuredImage":{"node":{"sourceUrl":"https://vitalsignscontenteditor.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_20240514_173343_6071281.jpg","altText":""}},"author":{"node":{"name":"Angry Workers","firstName":"Angry","lastName":"Workers","avatar":null}},"pdf":{"pdf":null},"categories":{"edges":[{"node":{"name":"International"}}]},"tags":{"edges":[]},"content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eWe document a speech by an apprentice care worker held at a recent \u0026#8216;Walk of Care\u0026#8217; in Berlin. The \u0026#8216;Walk of Care\u0026#8217; emerged out of a series of meetings of health and care workers in Berlin. For several years now, they have been organising regular protests against shortcomings in the care sector. This year the protests were joined by midwives, physios, critical medical students and patients. Amongst other things, they demanded a general and free health service that meets the needs of the patients, a 30-hour week for health workers, and a living wage for relatives and friends who care for their next of kin.

But when the system is geared toward profit maximisation, this unfortunately gets in the way of our aims. In this case we are just supposed to restore people\u0026#8217;s labour power (meaning,  the physical and mental minimum to go to work) or, if their ability to work has been exhausted, to accompany them to death.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eAn economic system that is geared towards the maximisation of profits has no interest in caring for people: it seeks efficiency. An economic system focused on making more and more money creates jobs in which the interests of the workers are always worth less than the profit that can be made from them. Profit has always come before human lives, and we experience that very directly.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eWe experience the importance of our work for patients and the community. But we currently cannot influence the wider conditions of our labour. Nursing work increasingly takes place in an environment characterised by financial cuts, overtime, discrimination between “profitable” and “unprofitable” patients, and the exploitation of immigrant workers and women in particular. At the same time, cutbacks jeopardise psychological and social services and health care for vulnerable and highly marginalised groups in society. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eThese conditions mean that care workers, patients and people in need of care face precariousness. Staff shortages and constant work overload lead to psychological suffering, exhaustion, and fear of causing harm or making mistakes. As care workers, we experience daily that we are unable to meet our expectations and do justice to our patients. When there is hardly any time for humane care, the dehumanisation of patients is the protective reaction of many care workers. Getting through the shift is the order of the day. Often, professional nursing workers only stay in their profession for a few years after their training.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eWe must fight so that our work is not reduced to a series of interventions and measures around the sick body. Other futures are possible: community-oriented and/or self-managed care that develops ideas of health and care through its practice, based on the needs and interests of the communities with which it interacts directly. We must be prepared to challenge and resist the limitations of our roles and of the institutional structures that govern our practice. Our autonomy is important if we are to provide dignified care that is not hindered by the over-regulation and economisation of the health and care sector.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eLet us build more just and collaborative relationships.

Without nursing, it would not work. However, it is not enough to improve staffing. Nor is it enough to denounce the injustices of our work environment. We need to defend our interests as workers and patients. And we know that we have a better chance of asserting our interests if we join forces, form majorities and develop power through collective processes, commitments and solidarity.

The RAF is dropping bombs on Yemen. It\u0026#8217;s not much of a revelation to say that war is bad, but why do we think it\u0026#8217;s important to talk about it here? Do we really need more bad news about war? The truth is that, against the general narrative, war isn’t something that just affects those people miles away. Instead, the impact is felt across the whole of our society and involves all of us. Over the next 10 years, the Government has committed to spending an extra £230 billion on weapons and military equipment, while the NHS is told to tighten its belt and more and more of it are auctioned to the highest bidder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeriods of crisis, economic or otherwise, have historically been a precursor to war. The competition over markets and territory when things get tough creates tensions between countries that inevitably boil over into conflict in a search for domination over land and labour. These conflicts are justified by calls for “patriotism” in service of the “national interest”, always only a thin veil over the call for a working class massacre. After all, it’s never the politicians who fight the wars. They leave that to us, our brothers and our sisters, the working class.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2022, after the Covid pandemic, the impacts of the war on supply chains and government finances contributed heavily to the inflation crisis that was felt across the world. In a direct way, the war was used as an excuse by governments and employers to attack the pay and conditions of workers across the world. During the strikes in the NHS, when we were pushing back against these attacks, we were accused of “serving the interests of Putin” by politicians. When faced with crises such as war, national governments double down on simplistic stories about ‘us vs them’ and ‘good vs evil’, to lean into nationalist feelings. They do this to disguise the fact that in wars between nations, the interests of workers are not the same as ‘our’ governments and corporations. They paint an imaginary picture which falls apart at the first interaction with reality. This ideology of nationalism is just a blatant attempt to create false divisions within the working class, pushing us to line up behind one group of rulers or another. This puts us in a weaker position as a class, as we give passive support to the governments to dictate to an even greater extent what happens with the resources that our class, the working class, creates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe outbreak of a hot phase of the war in Palestine has added to the general push towards war. Every day there is another warning about how this or that attack is threatening to turn the war there into a regional war. The tension between the countries reliant on Chinese dominated markets and finance on the one hand, and the US sphere of influence on the other is creating cracks in the global order. Ukraine was the first link in the chain to break, but the war in Palestine needs to be seen as another step in the same journey to barbarism and not as an isolated abnormality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the next few years, there will be more calls for war. Politicians and talking heads have been lining up to babble on about the need to bring back national service in the UK, how the UK military isn’t prepared for a war with Russia and that more money needs to be spent on buying weapons and military equipment. This might seem like a contradiction; at the same time that they are telling us that they don\u0026#8217;t have the ability to offer us anything beyond another pay cut, they are dusting off billions to pay for missiles and warplanes. In the end though it makes more sense for them to pump money into inhuman and destructive goals. There is a deep underlying economic crisis in slow motion across the world that is creating instability across the world economy, and war is a tried and tested method for governments and bosses to direct people’s anger away from the system that keeps them powerful, and toward some other group of governments and bosses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgainst the bosses’ logic of patriotism and industrial slaughter, workers in Italy have shown what international solidarity amongst the working class can look like. Dockers in Genoa refused to load cargo to ships that they suspected to be weapons. Recently, workers in India have refused to handle any materials that they believe are bound for the Israeli state’s war with Hamas, where over 30,000 people have been slaughtered in Gaza. Historically, workers’ refusal to participate brought an end to the first world war, with massive waves of strikes in Germany and a revolution in Russia brought down the imperial war machines on both sides. We need to create the kind of organisations that resist this pull toward militarisation locally and internationally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt might seem like we’re removed from these wars; there are no bombs falling in Bristol, but they are being made in Bristol. We’re encouraged to sit quietly while our national government allows and even encourages this slide towards global war. At the same time, workers are beginning to resist this. Health workers in the UK have formed groups in solidarity with health workers in Gaza, highlighting the connections between us and our brothers and sisters elsewhere and demonstrating that our interests are not aligned with those of the bosses and the government but in our common struggle against this inhuman system that throws the bodies of thousands of workers into the meat grinder to ensure that the profit keeps flowing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe NHS is made up of workers from all over the world with common problems and issues. We need to continue to fight against the attempts to create barriers between us, whether those are religious, ethnic or national, by job role, band, profession or union. We need to do this to create an example for the wider working class that our interests are not those of the national governments or the bosses who push them, but are in fighting for a new society without exploitation of our lives and work.\u003c/p\u003e\n"}},{"node":{"title":"Learning from health workers in Argentina – On the current rebellion in Neuquén","excerpt":"\u003cp\u003eWhat started as a health workers’ dispute has turned into a regional uprising.

This fierce betrayal of union (ATE) representatives was the straw that broke the camel’s back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn March 2nd, a large inter-hospital meeting of health workers was held in the centre of Neuquén, the provincial capital. They decided to demand that wage negotiations be resumed, a 40% increase for 2020 and an adjustment in line with inflation for 2021. They also decided to coordinate their demands with the teachers’ union, ATEN, and to draw up a joint action plan. ATEN had rejected the same wage proposal a few days earlier, and decided not to resume classes on March 3rd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, various conflicts were spreading in the region. Social movements blocked rural road bridges and other points for an increase in support programs; schools throughout the province made demands of the state; and the feminist movement took to the streets against the femicide of Guadalupe Curual in Villa La Angostura. On March 10th, self-organized health workers, opposition to the ATEN union leadership, other public sector workers, workers in the self-managed tile factories, and social movements came together in a demonstration that ended at the main government building. On March 12th, health workers with the union of justice workers (SEJUN) blocked the bridges between Neuquén and Cipolletti. Meanwhile, ATEN maintained a protest camp in front of the government building. There was still no response from the political side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn March 16th, the provincial government agreed to add 3% to the wage increase, for a total of 15%. At the same time, the health workers rehearsed a first blockade of the oil route, the roads through which the project of Vaca Muerta is carried out. (Vaca Muerta is an oil shale deposit where they’re fracking). The government continued to refuse to meet with the self-organized workers. ATEN’s union leadership pushed through the approval of the wage proposal, even though it meant a significant loss of wages. On the same day, the Cerámica Neuquén tile factory (which had been taken over by the workers*) was again threatened with eviction and auction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn March 24th, (the anniversary of the 1976 coup), thousands again took to the streets. In addition to the usual demands for commemoration, truth and justice, health was big on peoples’ agenda, demonstrating the broad legitimacy health workers now had amongst the wider population. More roadblocks, this time to famous tourist destinations, resulted in more clashes. The traffic chaos and growing criticism of a continued lack of response from the government emboldened health sector workers to expand their struggle further.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"wordads-ad-wrapper\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"atatags-26942-551511\" data-adtags-width=\"740\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOil and gas blockades\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Neuquén area is known for its oil and gas industry. On April 7th, a series of indefinite blockades began at strategic points along the oil route, focussing on Añelo, the neuralgic centre of Vaca Muerta. Through the roadblocks, workers have been mainly targeting the trucks transporting fuel from the Vaca Muerta refinery, while letting the rest of the drivers pass. The blockades have made it difficult to drill new wells, forcing the closure of smaller wells, and causing problems at processing plants that threaten Buenos Aires’ gas supply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the government continued its silence, the number of blockades increased to twelve by April 10th. For the last two weeks, 30 roadblocks have paralysed the activities of the petroleum industry in Vaca Muerta.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn parallel, a meeting was convened with social movements, unions, parties and local organizations in the city of Neuquén at the Castro Rendón Hospital, the largest hospital in the province. A few hours after this meeting, the state energy company of the province, EPEN, cut off the electricity to the worker-run Zanon-FaSinPat tile factory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first, the authorities had maintained that pay rise negotiations would only take place with the unions and refused to meet with the strikers. Finally, after weeks of unofficial actions, the provincial government agreed to meet the protestors but after a couple of meetings, which the workers considered unproductive and a waste of their time, they decided to leave the negotiation table until there was an acceptable pay rise proposal from the government.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e“We left our answer on the table and told them that we are not going to accept any more teasing, as they did yesterday (Friday 16th) when they kept us for 9 hours in sterile discussions. When they have a proposal for an increase in the basic pay, they can call us and we will sit down to discuss it. In the meantime we will continue to hold roadblocks and deepen the measures.”\u003c/em\u003e said one of the representatives of the workers, after last Saturday’s meeting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThroughout all this, the Mapuche communities in the Añelo area have been joining the pickets. The situation with the truck drivers has gone from conflicts and counter-pickets to solidarity. Workers have joined in solidarity and stayed outside the Ciudad Judicial where the negotiation meetings were held.\u003cbr /\u003e\nMeanwhile, almost all the union leaders not only do not support the strike but even openly attack it, like the leader of ATE Neuquén. The union leaders aligned with the Kirchner government, who went so far as to consider that it should be repressed, forcing all the sectional delegates to sign this declaration, which some of them denounced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the position of the union leaders, on the roads and in the streets of Neuquén, there is massive participation of health workers and massive support of teachers, as well as the active support of various militant unemployed movements. In addition, most of the oil workers and truck drivers appear to be getting closer to the health workers, despite the significant physical and monetary wear and tear that being stranded on the roads causes them on a daily basis. Some helped to block supply products for fracking, and have been maintaining food supplies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast week ended with a strike by the teachers’ union ATEN and the judiciary union SEJUN, which issued a joint statement with various unions at the Universidad del Comahue. It was a strike in solidarity with the health sector. The union leaders, under pressure from their own rank and file and large public support, could no longer stay out of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"wordads-ad-wrapper\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"atatags-26942-963534\" data-adtags-width=\"740\"\u003eIn a recent statement, the workers declared that: \u003cem\u003e¨(…) In the face of any offer from the government, it will be the assemblies of the hospitals and health centres, including the comrades who are on the different picket lines on the routes, who will decide whether to accept or reject it. If our rebellion was because a group of leaders decided on a miserable increase behind our backs, it will continue to be the rank and file who will decide the next steps. We call on the workers in each hospital and health centre to continue fighting for our decent pay and working conditions to continue in the front line of care for the population in this pandemic and the community to continue to support us.¨\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEffects of the uprising so far… \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe management tried to get oil workers to denounce health workers. Without success. The contractors complain about losses of millions. But the health workers’ struggle has also revealed that oil companies are raking in millions in profits every day. Another success of the ‘elephants’ (that’s what the health workers call their movement).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e“We work in conditions of overwork and overtiredness. We’ve had to maintain daily operations, with a lack of materials and rudimentary equipment.” Since early March 2021, the staff of the Centenario Hospital in the Argentine city of Neuquén has been on strike against planned austerity measures. The women are at the forefront of this. They are fighting against deteriorating working conditions and trying to make up for the loss of childcare in the pandemic. The offer made by Governor Gutiérrez on April 14 to pay a bonus of 30,000 pesos (270 euros) was rejected by the workers and they continue to strike, with energetic support from the public…”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://en.labournet.tv/strike-hospital-workers-neuquenargentina\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://en.labournet.tv/strike-hospital-workers-neuquenargentina\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n"}}]}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/posts/[slug]","query":{"slug":"strikes-have-to-be-able-to-emancipate-what-are-the-results-of-the-berlin-health-workers-strikes-of-2021"},"buildId":"CrL1x7qoG-wfhW0NKG71u","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
