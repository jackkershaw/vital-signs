class="max-w-2xl mx-auto"><div class="post-body_content__ye_eq"><p><em>This article was published in the Czech medical journal ‘Tempus Medicorum’ in June 2018</em></p>
<p>The Nurses’ Initiative has been operating in the Karlovy Vary Regional Hospital (KKN) for a year and a half. That is why we want to recapitulate what it has managed to do, what it has not had the strength to do, what methods it has adopted and what obstacles it has had to overcome. We appreciate the opportunity to summarize our balance sheet in a medical magazine, we want to share our experience with the medical ones.</p>
<p>The nurses’ initiative grew out of KKN workers’ realization in January 2017 that no one would stand up for us. So far we have won for a triple pay rise in KKN from the regional operator. In addition, last summer, the hospital paid a “shift bonus” to all nurses and assistants (and to a lesser extent, to carers and paramedics). Without having to negotiate for it. We all received a ten percent increase, automatically, starting in January 2018. There was no negotiation required. We got better off, noticeably.</p>
<p>We gained more in one year than we had in many years before. It wasn’t free on our part. We had to take a step into the unknown and rely on a long-run self-organisation and pressure from below, from the ground terrain, on the regional politicians, but most importantly on the management directly in the hospital. First of all, however, it was necessary to understand that even in the hospital, in the workplace, where we cannot strike effectively, it is possible to fight, not just negotiate. The road to that understanding was not and is not easy. It is necessary to deal with the dictates of long-established stereotypes.</p>
<p><em>To sacrifice ourselve means to deepen the crisis</em></p>
<p>There are many of these stereotypes, and they are ingrained in the operation of hospitals and in the health workers’ mentality. We began to untangle them when we asked the question: Why do nurses, etc. endure the devastation to their work and personal lives and to the quality of care so submissively and for so long? The answer offered itself: First and foremost, because our profession is a caring profession and we have, unfortunately, been indoctrinated that it must entail a willingness to sacrifice ourselves. But that is only the beginning of the answer.</p>
<p>In fact, we were sometimes even proud of ourselves for managing the work for absent colleagues and other professions. Sometimes we hoped that the more we did so, the more “someone would notice” and take pity on us and compensate us. We believed that it was enough if our testimonies reached the media, the public. But the list of obstacles that stand in the way of the self-confidence of nurses and the lower healthcare staff is much longer.</p>
<p>However, a following trap stands in the way not just to the nurses’ self-confidence for the struggle: there is a belief that those in charge, the politicians, the management, are just uninformed and therefore have no idea. However, that’s wrong, they have had their plan, their “solution” how to get through the hospital crisis, for a long time: it consists precisely in sacrificing staff, nurses and doctors, and making us endure it. This was and is their “crisis management”. Very cynical because it exploits the fact that politicians and management are not in touch with patients, their loved ones and the crisis of care on a daily basis. We are. We don’t hide in our offices.</p>
<p>But even that’s not all, there’s still the “Become the unpaid Minister of Health” trap: when health care workers speak up, they are being asked to sort out the entire health care system. “Are you complaining that this is unbearable? Ok, so propose a different plan, preferably for the whole country,” we hear… Yes, after the n-th night shift in a row, the hospital staff should probably do the work of ministers, governors, hospital directors for free!?</p>
<p>“My job is to put patients to sleep and wake them up, yours is to provide the money to keep the hospital running,” one of us, an anaesthesiology nurse, replied to the appeal of a regional councillor to join just another, a millionth committee. Her answer was right! It’s time to finally start from the needs of hospital staff and their patients. To put the system on its feet.</p>
<p>But how? How to make our voices heard so that those in charge feel it, concretely, practically, in a service where we are not allowed to strike?</p>
<p><em>To say “no” to the patching up of the service</em></p>
<p>Last spring, KKN’s infectious disease ward was threatened with closure due to the staff shortages, and the county politicians toured the facilities in the region to lure the nurses to get a side-job by offering better rates. At the time, we urged our colleagues not to come to our infectious diseases wards to help out. It caused an uproar in the county. It was reported that “the Initiative was threatening colleagues”. However, the external nurses understood why we did not want such “help”.</p>
<p>When KKN’s internal medicine unit was threatened with closure this January, the surgical department refused to join. Out of consideration for the internal and surgical staff and patients. And subsequently, some nurses from eleven KKN wards wrote declarations refusing to help out in the internal medicine ward. For the “privilege” of the double pay for helping out in the internal medicine, management finally managed to find two nurses from the entire hospital!</p>
<p>To say “no” to such patching up, to refuse to participate in such faking of the service, required courage, planning, organization and great responsibility. However, it was the understanding that it was such patching up and fiddling that brought the hospital, and not only ours, to its present state. Overpaying nurses from other departments and from outside the hospital, not following adaptation processes, forcing staff to go beyond their competencies and job descriptions… These are the ways of not solving the crisis, but prolonging it. If the managers and politicians refuse to take responsibility, the workers have to.</p>
<p><em>It’s about working conditions, not just the money</em></p>
<p>We have not opened the balance sheet by listing what we have achieved in terms of wages for the sake of boasting. After all, we did not achieve our demand for the introduction of national pay grades in the KKN. Regarding the pay grades, politicians, led by the regional governor Jana Vildumetzová and the councillor Jan Bures, as well as the management of the hospital director Jitka Samáková, deceived us for many months with promises that were only meant to calm down the KKN staff. When the time came to meet the promises, they ran away from them. We do not forget this. Nor do we forget that the state is increasing wages by 10 per cent in our sector, which has long been underfunded, in a situation where wages, and therefore competition, are rising throughout the labour market.</p>
<p>In taking stock of our experience, we wanted to move from the obvious to the harder but more important issues. We started with money to emphasise that it is not just about money. It is not a sensible choice to accept the devastation of one’s own profession and life, the decline of patient care, the deterioration of working conditions in exchange for more money.</p>
<p>It is all about refusing to cooperate with management and politicians in their gambling with care, in their trampling on the profession, in devastating the working and living conditions of the staff, nurses and doctors. The big “no’s”, of which we at KKN have only been able to say “a few” through much of the hospital, are obvious. But it is the small “no’s” on the ground in the workplaces which really matter: to refuse to do the work instead of another profession (important, but not my job!), to insist on having a break or its reimbursement, to refuse to exceed the workload, that my superiors force me to do because of the staffing crisis and thus risk legal action against me, to refuse to have a staff “reinforcement” assigned to the ward, who as a non-nurse is supposed to do the nurse’s work and for whose misconduct I will then be responsible…</p>
<p>Such “small” but immediate “no’s” will get inscribed into the self-esteem of the staff. They have the power to change the practices of the service. They require individual courage, collective intelligence and co-operation. They are the “no’s” of breaking the rules. It is a method of struggle how to push, step by step, from below, from the practice, for a solution. How to create, through our own responsibility (for our own health and our lives, and for the health and lives of the patients), a situation in which politicians and managers can no longer run away from their responsibilities. To ensure that the impact of us sticking to the rulebook will reach from the bottom of the hospital, through the middle ranks, up to the top levels and above the hospital, to the national level.</p>
<p>We are very grateful for the opportunity to look back on our year and a half in this medical journal. For many reasons. Because we share a workplace with the doctors. Because it is good to exchange experiences of fighting for better money, conditions and greater professional pride, which the crisis in hospitals is taking away from us (after all, it was from the experience of the doctors’ movement “Thank you, we are leaving” that we started to organize). Because the better working conditions the doctors and nurses have, the easier it will be to work together.</p>
<p>The nurses’ initiative</p>

<p>———</p>
<p><strong>Two leaflets from the Initiative</strong></p>
<p><em>Experience from practice: how we fight in our department</em></p>
<p>Even a “small” rebellion on the ward is the beginning of a journey towards self-confidence. The following “NO” (“NO” to regulations’ violations) experiences are proof of this. They may seem “trivial”, but at KKN they have actually opened the way for other “NOs”, they inspired and gave courage. They set an example. And in the end, with other “NOs” from other departments, they created a collective force and generated pressure. And from the other side – they required courage to start, to hold the line and act as an organized collective.</p>
<p>Our experience is from the central operating theatres: we agreed collectively that we did not want to refuse overtime work (each of us had her own reasons). Therefore, we were looking for another way how to put the management under pressure.</p>
<p>The very first thing was the observance of lunch breaks. As simple as it sounds, even that was a fight. Following the Labour Code, we began to take our lunch break at peace, no later than 1pm. We had to break their resistance to get that.</p>
<p>The next step was to comply with the standards when admitting and handing over the patients: from now on, nice and easy, with regard for the patient, not at mad speed. Not as before in a rush and with an often stressed out patient on the operating table.</p>
<p>Then we looked around for what other regulations say. Hygiene, for example. These, for example, impose an exposure time for each disinfection (but we can call it a “mopping break” because that’s what the term means :)). So? So, after wiping, we began to wait for 15 minutes, as our disinfection rules require. Only then we moved on to the next patient. Sure, it may sound boring, too basic, but what a fight was it! “Who do you think you are?” “How dare you to slow down the procedural order?”</p>
<p>All these little steps, one after another, led to a general outrage. It took a long time to get them accepted even by those who should have followed them in the first place.</p>
<p>And what has it given to us? Many gains, in every respect. For example, we don’t slip on wet floors anymore, we don’t breathe in the fumes of disinfectant solutions (there are studies on the harm of inhaling these fumes over a long period of time), operating rooms are disinfected as they should be. We eat lunch around noon like humans. We don’t rush around as we used to. Patients benefit from our approach.</p>
<p>But it has brought out something extra, something that actually reaches beyond our department. Someone may believe that these are just some small things (but those who deal with such things know that changing them is not an easy ride). But when more and more departments start to change the existing, established way of working on similar “little things”, when the amount of those little things grows and grows, many little flames will turn into fires. And gradually they will burn their way up to management. And yes, eventually management will realize that the old ways just don’t cut it. That we need to bring in new nurses. That there is no other option – that it just can’t and never will be done without nurses.</p>
<p>Each department has its own specifics, its own procedures. But working conditions can be improved everywhere. This is for a longer conversation. Everywhere you can “use a lever” to change the stereotypes (and the given awareness of nurses). It just needs taking a distance from the learned, from the automated. These are all steps that are consistent with the standards, regulations, the Labour code. They are all by the book. No one can accuse us of doing something wrong, let alone punish us for it.</p>
<p>Of course, many of us have been targeted by colleagues who, from a position of power, thought they could bring us back to the “obedience”. We stood our ground. And we will continue to fight in this way. Firstly, because although the leadership in KKN promised us the national pay grades, they have not kept their promise – and we do not want to work with someone who does not keep their promises. And secondly, because we aim to straighten our professional pride and working conditions for good.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to say that it is sad that we as health professionals have to use sticking to the Labour code as a threat. After all, it should be the alpha and omega. That is why it must be emphasised: the entire health sector today is based on non-compliance with the Labour Code, and those responsible are ignoring this dangerous fact.</p>
<p>It is up to us to change this.</p>
<p>———</p>
<p><em>How to seek a pay rise in your hospital</em></p>
<p>Union negotiations with the government are unlikely to yield even 10% pay rise. In any case, they will guarantee less than a quarter of a percent pay rise to the staff in private health care. They have been thrown over the board. However, they (but not only them) have a chance to gain more. Hospitals will get a record amount of money from the government through the compensation scheme. Now the point is to force our managements to spend these money on wages. To give it to the people who keep the health care afloat. To those to who the management owes a lot. To those who are paying for the staffing crisis without having had caused it. To give it to the staff – nurses, assistants, carers, paramedics, doctors, cleaners.</p>
<p>To force the management… Does it seem mission impossible? It’s not impossible. We have a proof, an example, that it can be done. The first issue of our paper will be about how to do just that.</p>
<p>Yes, we can! An example from the Karlovy Vary Regional Hospital (KKN)</p>
<p>Three pay rises in one year, which also meant that some of the nursing categories in the joint-stock company get better basic pay than according to the national state pay grades. Shift allowance from summer 2017 for all nurses, not just those on shifts, and to a lesser extent for others, nursing assistants and paramedics. As of January 2018, the national 10 percent rise. Better working conditions on the militant wards. And above all: more self-confidence in relation to the management.</p>
<p>This is the result of the struggle that began in February 2017 at KKN. Yet, as recently as December 2016, no one there could have imagined that such a thing was possible. At the beginning, there were several female colleagues. Gradually, the initiative grew into a self-organisation, a force that was able to put a lot of pressure on the regional government and on the leadership.</p>
<p>The Initiative made it in KKN also because it understood the following:</p>
<p>Staff must stand up for themselves. Poor pay and conditions are also the result of relying on “someone to sort it out for us” (unions, media, politicians, labour inspections…).</p>
<p>The strength is in the departments uniting from below. In practice, this meant mapping and comparing workplace conditions, our own meetings (outside working time), producing a newspaper, setting up different whatsapp and email groups…</p>
<p>→ We need to have the basics of self-organisation before we start talking to management. Not the other way around.</p>
<p>The strength is in the struggle, not in negotiations! Our potential strength (read on to see what it may look like) is in the hospital, in the terrain, in the wards, on the job, not in the office at a negotiating table.</p>
<p>→ The principle is: as much direct pressure as possible from the bottom of the ward first, negotiation afterwards and as little as possible.</p>
<p>We don’t care where the employer will find the money for higher wages. “We don’t have the money for wages”, “we are in debt” are the first answers we hear. In KKN, the nurses said, “You – the politicians and management – don’t care where we find the money to pay our bills from our miserable wages, or who is looking after our kids when we are doing the n-th shift in a row… We, in turn, don’t care where you get the money for higher wages.”</p>
<p>→ Let’s not get sucked into the responsibility of “finding resources”. We’re nurses, assistants, carers, paramedics, we’re not managers – that’s their job. Let’s not get sucked into the task forces and endless meetings.</p>
<p>The struggle, the pressure, must be based on the conditions in specific wards. Perhaps in every hospital, in every ward, operations are “patched up” with overtime beyond the legal mandatory limit, with violations of regulations, job descriptions, standards… If we say “NO” to this, management will have to back down.</p>
<p>→ There is no single method of fighting. It has to fit the workplace. But the fight must be coordinated.</p>
<p>We need to be radical and patient. It’s not just a fight with management. It’s also a fight with passivity, obedience, the mentality of “don’t get yourself into a trouble…” and “the negotiation is still on, just be patient and see how it turns out, the fight is not appropriate at the moment…”. All of this has intoxicated our departments for years. It’s taken its toll on us. It’s a long haul to change that.</p>
<p>There are many more lessons to be learned. These are the most basic. Others will be spelled out in the future issues of the paper. And you yourselves will discover yet other lessons as soon as you will you launch yourselves into building self-organization and struggle (with us). Contact us!</p>
<p>Let’s be strong and smart = let’s organize, independently, from below.</p>

That is why we want to recapitulate what it has managed to do, what it has not had the strength to do, what methods it has adopted and what obstacles it has had to overcome. We appreciate the opportunity to summarize our balance sheet in a medical magazine, we want to share our experience with the medical ones.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nurses’ initiative grew out of KKN workers’ realization in January 2017 that no one would stand up for us. So far we have won for a triple pay rise in KKN from the regional operator. In addition, last summer, the hospital paid a “shift bonus” to all nurses and assistants (and to a lesser extent, to carers and paramedics). Without having to negotiate for it. We all received a ten percent increase, automatically, starting in January 2018. There was no negotiation required. We got better off, noticeably.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe gained more in one year than we had in many years before. It wasn’t free on our part. We had to take a step into the unknown and rely on a long-run self-organisation and pressure from below, from the ground terrain, on the regional politicians, but most importantly on the management directly in the hospital. First of all, however, it was necessary to understand that even in the hospital, in the workplace, where we cannot strike effectively, it is possible to fight, not just negotiate. The road to that understanding was not and is not easy. It is necessary to deal with the dictates of long-established stereotypes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eTo sacrifice ourselve means to deepen the crisis\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are many of these stereotypes, and they are ingrained in the operation of hospitals and in the health workers’ mentality. We began to untangle them when we asked the question: Why do nurses, etc. endure the devastation to their work and personal lives and to the quality of care so submissively and for so long? The answer offered itself: First and foremost, because our profession is a caring profession and we have, unfortunately, been indoctrinated that it must entail a willingness to sacrifice ourselves. But that is only the beginning of the answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn fact, we were sometimes even proud of ourselves for managing the work for absent colleagues and other professions. Sometimes we hoped that the more we did so, the more “someone would notice” and take pity on us and compensate us. We believed that it was enough if our testimonies reached the media, the public. But the list of obstacles that stand in the way of the self-confidence of nurses and the lower healthcare staff is much longer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, a following trap stands in the way not just to the nurses’ self-confidence for the struggle: there is a belief that those in charge, the politicians, the management, are just uninformed and therefore have no idea. However, that’s wrong, they have had their plan, their “solution” how to get through the hospital crisis, for a long time: it consists precisely in sacrificing staff, nurses and doctors, and making us endure it. This was and is their “crisis management”. Very cynical because it exploits the fact that politicians and management are not in touch with patients, their loved ones and the crisis of care on a daily basis. We are. We don’t hide in our offices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut even that’s not all, there’s still the “Become the unpaid Minister of Health” trap: when health care workers speak up, they are being asked to sort out the entire health care system. “Are you complaining that this is unbearable? Ok, so propose a different plan, preferably for the whole country,” we hear… Yes, after the n-th night shift in a row, the hospital staff should probably do the work of ministers, governors, hospital directors for free!?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My job is to put patients to sleep and wake them up, yours is to provide the money to keep the hospital running,” one of us, an anaesthesiology nurse, replied to the appeal of a regional councillor to join just another, a millionth committee. Her answer was right! It’s time to finally start from the needs of hospital staff and their patients. To put the system on its feet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut how? How to make our voices heard so that those in charge feel it, concretely, practically, in a service where we are not allowed to strike?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eTo say “no” to the patching up of the service\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast spring, KKN’s infectious disease ward was threatened with closure due to the staff shortages, and the county politicians toured the facilities in the region to lure the nurses to get a side-job by offering better rates. At the time, we urged our colleagues not to come to our infectious diseases wards to help out. It caused an uproar in the county. It was reported that “the Initiative was threatening colleagues”. However, the external nurses understood why we did not want such “help”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen KKN’s internal medicine unit was threatened with closure this January, the surgical department refused to join. Out of consideration for the internal and surgical staff and patients. And subsequently, some nurses from eleven KKN wards wrote declarations refusing to help out in the internal medicine ward. For the “privilege” of the double pay for helping out in the internal medicine, management finally managed to find two nurses from the entire hospital!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo say “no” to such patching up, to refuse to participate in such faking of the service, required courage, planning, organization and great responsibility. However, it was the understanding that it was such patching up and fiddling that brought the hospital, and not only ours, to its present state. Overpaying nurses from other departments and from outside the hospital, not following adaptation processes, forcing staff to go beyond their competencies and job descriptions… These are the ways of not solving the crisis, but prolonging it. If the managers and politicians refuse to take responsibility, the workers have to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eIt’s about working conditions, not just the money\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe have not opened the balance sheet by listing what we have achieved in terms of wages for the sake of boasting. After all, we did not achieve our demand for the introduction of national pay grades in the KKN. Regarding the pay grades, politicians, led by the regional governor Jana Vildumetzová and the councillor Jan Bures, as well as the management of the hospital director Jitka Samáková, deceived us for many months with promises that were only meant to calm down the KKN staff. When the time came to meet the promises, they ran away from them. We do not forget this. Nor do we forget that the state is increasing wages by 10 per cent in our sector, which has long been underfunded, in a situation where wages, and therefore competition, are rising throughout the labour market.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn taking stock of our experience, we wanted to move from the obvious to the harder but more important issues. We started with money to emphasise that it is not just about money. It is not a sensible choice to accept the devastation of one’s own profession and life, the decline of patient care, the deterioration of working conditions in exchange for more money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is all about refusing to cooperate with management and politicians in their gambling with care, in their trampling on the profession, in devastating the working and living conditions of the staff, nurses and doctors. The big “no’s”, of which we at KKN have only been able to say “a few” through much of the hospital, are obvious. But it is the small “no’s” on the ground in the workplaces which really matter: to refuse to do the work instead of another profession (important, but not my job!), to insist on having a break or its reimbursement, to refuse to exceed the workload, that my superiors force me to do because of the staffing crisis and thus risk legal action against me, to refuse to have a staff “reinforcement” assigned to the ward, who as a non-nurse is supposed to do the nurse’s work and for whose misconduct I will then be responsible…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuch “small” but immediate “no’s” will get inscribed into the self-esteem of the staff. They have the power to change the practices of the service. They require individual courage, collective intelligence and co-operation. They are the “no’s” of breaking the rules. It is a method of struggle how to push, step by step, from below, from the practice, for a solution. How to create, through our own responsibility (for our own health and our lives, and for the health and lives of the patients), a situation in which politicians and managers can no longer run away from their responsibilities. To ensure that the impact of us sticking to the rulebook will reach from the bottom of the hospital, through the middle ranks, up to the top levels and above the hospital, to the national level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are very grateful for the opportunity to look back on our year and a half in this medical journal. For many reasons. Because we share a workplace with the doctors. Because it is good to exchange experiences of fighting for better money, conditions and greater professional pride, which the crisis in hospitals is taking away from us (after all, it was from the experience of the doctors’ movement “Thank you, we are leaving” that we started to organize). Because the better working conditions the doctors and nurses have, the easier it will be to work together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe nurses’ initiative\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eorganizujemese.cz\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e———\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTwo leaflets from the Initiative\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eExperience from practice: how we fight in our department\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven a “small” rebellion on the ward is the beginning of a journey towards self-confidence. The following “NO” (“NO” to regulations’ violations) experiences are proof of this. They may seem “trivial”, but at KKN they have actually opened the way for other “NOs”, they inspired and gave courage. They set an example. And in the end, with other “NOs” from other departments, they created a collective force and generated pressure. And from the other side – they required courage to start, to hold the line and act as an organized collective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur experience is from the central operating theatres: we agreed collectively that we did not want to refuse overtime work (each of us had her own reasons). Therefore, we were looking for another way how to put the management under pressure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe very first thing was the observance of lunch breaks. As simple as it sounds, even that was a fight. Following the Labour Code, we began to take our lunch break at peace, no later than 1pm. We had to break their resistance to get that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next step was to comply with the standards when admitting and handing over the patients: from now on, nice and easy, with regard for the patient, not at mad speed. Not as before in a rush and with an often stressed out patient on the operating table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen we looked around for what other regulations say. Hygiene, for example. These, for example, impose an exposure time for each disinfection (but we can call it a “mopping break” because that’s what the term means :)). So? So, after wiping, we began to wait for 15 minutes, as our disinfection rules require. Only then we moved on to the next patient. Sure, it may sound boring, too basic, but what a fight was it! “Who do you think you are?” “How dare you to slow down the procedural order?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll these little steps, one after another, led to a general outrage. It took a long time to get them accepted even by those who should have followed them in the first place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd what has it given to us? Many gains, in every respect. For example, we don’t slip on wet floors anymore, we don’t breathe in the fumes of disinfectant solutions (there are studies on the harm of inhaling these fumes over a long period of time), operating rooms are disinfected as they should be. We eat lunch around noon like humans. We don’t rush around as we used to. Patients benefit from our approach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut it has brought out something extra, something that actually reaches beyond our department. Someone may believe that these are just some small things (but those who deal with such things know that changing them is not an easy ride). But when more and more departments start to change the existing, established way of working on similar “little things”, when the amount of those little things grows and grows, many little flames will turn into fires. And gradually they will burn their way up to management. And yes, eventually management will realize that the old ways just don’t cut it. That we need to bring in new nurses. That there is no other option – that it just can’t and never will be done without nurses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach department has its own specifics, its own procedures. But working conditions can be improved everywhere. This is for a longer conversation. Everywhere you can “use a lever” to change the stereotypes (and the given awareness of nurses). It just needs taking a distance from the learned, from the automated. These are all steps that are consistent with the standards, regulations, the Labour code. They are all by the book. No one can accuse us of doing something wrong, let alone punish us for it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, many of us have been targeted by colleagues who, from a position of power, thought they could bring us back to the “obedience”. We stood our ground. And we will continue to fight in this way. Firstly, because although the leadership in KKN promised us the national pay grades, they have not kept their promise – and we do not want to work with someone who does not keep their promises. And secondly, because we aim to straighten our professional pride and working conditions for good.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, I would like to say that it is sad that we as health professionals have to use sticking to the Labour code as a threat. After all, it should be the alpha and omega. That is why it must be emphasised: the entire health sector today is based on non-compliance with the Labour Code, and those responsible are ignoring this dangerous fact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is up to us to change this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e———\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eHow to seek a pay rise in your hospital\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnion negotiations with the government are unlikely to yield even 10% pay rise. In any case, they will guarantee less than a quarter of a percent pay rise to the staff in private health care. They have been thrown over the board. However, they (but not only them) have a chance to gain more. Hospitals will get a record amount of money from the government through the compensation scheme. Now the point is to force our managements to spend these money on wages. To give it to the people who keep the health care afloat. To those to who the management owes a lot. To those who are paying for the staffing crisis without having had caused it. To give it to the staff – nurses, assistants, carers, paramedics, doctors, cleaners.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo force the management… Does it seem mission impossible? It’s not impossible. We have a proof, an example, that it can be done. The first issue of our paper will be about how to do just that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, we can! An example from the Karlovy Vary Regional Hospital (KKN)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThree pay rises in one year, which also meant that some of the nursing categories in the joint-stock company get better basic pay than according to the national state pay grades. Shift allowance from summer 2017 for all nurses, not just those on shifts, and to a lesser extent for others, nursing assistants and paramedics. As of January 2018, the national 10 percent rise. Better working conditions on the militant wards. And above all: more self-confidence in relation to the management.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is the result of the struggle that began in February 2017 at KKN. Yet, as recently as December 2016, no one there could have imagined that such a thing was possible. At the beginning, there were several female colleagues. Gradually, the initiative grew into a self-organisation, a force that was able to put a lot of pressure on the regional government and on the leadership.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Initiative made it in KKN also because it understood the following:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStaff must stand up for themselves. Poor pay and conditions are also the result of relying on “someone to sort it out for us” (unions, media, politicians, labour inspections…).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe strength is in the departments uniting from below. In practice, this meant mapping and comparing workplace conditions, our own meetings (outside working time), producing a newspaper, setting up different whatsapp and email groups…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e→ We need to have the basics of self-organisation before we start talking to management. Not the other way around.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe strength is in the struggle, not in negotiations! Our potential strength (read on to see what it may look like) is in the hospital, in the terrain, in the wards, on the job, not in the office at a negotiating table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e→ The principle is: as much direct pressure as possible from the bottom of the ward first, negotiation afterwards and as little as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe don’t care where the employer will find the money for higher wages. “We don’t have the money for wages”, “we are in debt” are the first answers we hear. In KKN, the nurses said, “You – the politicians and management – don’t care where we find the money to pay our bills from our miserable wages, or who is looking after our kids when we are doing the n-th shift in a row… We, in turn, don’t care where you get the money for higher wages.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e→ Let’s not get sucked into the responsibility of “finding resources”. We’re nurses, assistants, carers, paramedics, we’re not managers – that’s their job. Let’s not get sucked into the task forces and endless meetings.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe struggle, the pressure, must be based on the conditions in specific wards. Perhaps in every hospital, in every ward, operations are “patched up” with overtime beyond the legal mandatory limit, with violations of regulations, job descriptions, standards… If we say “NO” to this, management will have to back down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e→ There is no single method of fighting. It has to fit the workplace. But the fight must be coordinated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe need to be radical and patient. It’s not just a fight with management. It’s also a fight with passivity, obedience, the mentality of “don’t get yourself into a trouble…” and “the negotiation is still on, just be patient and see how it turns out, the fight is not appropriate at the moment…”. All of this has intoxicated our departments for years. It’s taken its toll on us. It’s a long haul to change that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are many more lessons to be learned. These are the most basic. Others will be spelled out in the future issues of the paper. And you yourselves will discover yet other lessons as soon as you will you launch yourselves into building self-organization and struggle (with us).

The \u0026#8216;Walk of Care\u0026#8217; emerged out of a series of meetings of health and care workers in Berlin. For several years now, they have been organising regular protests against shortcomings in the care sector. This year the protests were joined by midwives, physios, critical medical students and patients. Amongst other things, they demanded a general and free health service that meets the needs of the patients, a 30-hour week for health workers, and a living wage for relatives and friends who care for their next of kin.

But when the system is geared toward profit maximisation, this unfortunately gets in the way of our aims. In this case we are just supposed to restore people\u0026#8217;s labour power (meaning,  the physical and mental minimum to go to work) or, if their ability to work has been exhausted, to accompany them to death.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eAn economic system that is geared towards the maximisation of profits has no interest in caring for people: it seeks efficiency. An economic system focused on making more and more money creates jobs in which the interests of the workers are always worth less than the profit that can be made from them. Profit has always come before human lives, and we experience that very directly.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eWe experience the importance of our work for patients and the community. But we currently cannot influence the wider conditions of our labour. Nursing work increasingly takes place in an environment characterised by financial cuts, overtime, discrimination between “profitable” and “unprofitable” patients, and the exploitation of immigrant workers and women in particular. At the same time, cutbacks jeopardise psychological and social services and health care for vulnerable and highly marginalised groups in society. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eThese conditions mean that care workers, patients and people in need of care face precariousness. Staff shortages and constant work overload lead to psychological suffering, exhaustion, and fear of causing harm or making mistakes. As care workers, we experience daily that we are unable to meet our expectations and do justice to our patients. When there is hardly any time for humane care, the dehumanisation of patients is the protective reaction of many care workers. Getting through the shift is the order of the day. Often, professional nursing workers only stay in their profession for a few years after their training.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eWe must fight so that our work is not reduced to a series of interventions and measures around the sick body. Other futures are possible: community-oriented and/or self-managed care that develops ideas of health and care through its practice, based on the needs and interests of the communities with which it interacts directly. We must be prepared to challenge and resist the limitations of our roles and of the institutional structures that govern our practice. Our autonomy is important if we are to provide dignified care that is not hindered by the over-regulation and economisation of the health and care sector.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eLet us build more just and collaborative relationships. By reducing power imbalances we can improve care practice. Solidarity among colleagues is paramount: let us engage with colleagues and healthcare professionals from other specialties or settings. Dialogue between different social groups is also important: we must nurture relationships between patients, staff, friends and family in order to create a permanent state of solidarity and support in the healthcare institutions.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eThe numerous recent protest actions have shown that the system is sustained through us. Without nursing, it would not work. However, it is not enough to improve staffing. Nor is it enough to denounce the injustices of our work environment. We need to defend our interests as workers and patients. And we know that we have a better chance of asserting our interests if we join forces, form majorities and develop power through collective processes, commitments and solidarity. The time has come to enforce fundamental changes ourselves.

The RAF is dropping bombs on Yemen. It\u0026#8217;s not much of a revelation to say that war is bad, but why do we think it\u0026#8217;s important to talk about it here? Do we really need more bad news about war? The truth is that, against the general narrative, war isn’t something that just affects those people miles away. Instead, the impact is felt across the whole of our society and involves all of us. Over the next 10 years, the Government has committed to spending an extra £230 billion on weapons and military equipment, while the NHS is told to tighten its belt and more and more of it are auctioned to the highest bidder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeriods of crisis, economic or otherwise, have historically been a precursor to war. The competition over markets and territory when things get tough creates tensions between countries that inevitably boil over into conflict in a search for domination over land and labour. These conflicts are justified by calls for “patriotism” in service of the “national interest”, always only a thin veil over the call for a working class massacre. After all, it’s never the politicians who fight the wars. They leave that to us, our brothers and our sisters, the working class.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2022, after the Covid pandemic, the impacts of the war on supply chains and government finances contributed heavily to the inflation crisis that was felt across the world. In a direct way, the war was used as an excuse by governments and employers to attack the pay and conditions of workers across the world. During the strikes in the NHS, when we were pushing back against these attacks, we were accused of “serving the interests of Putin” by politicians. When faced with crises such as war, national governments double down on simplistic stories about ‘us vs them’ and ‘good vs evil’, to lean into nationalist feelings. They do this to disguise the fact that in wars between nations, the interests of workers are not the same as ‘our’ governments and corporations. They paint an imaginary picture which falls apart at the first interaction with reality. This ideology of nationalism is just a blatant attempt to create false divisions within the working class, pushing us to line up behind one group of rulers or another. This puts us in a weaker position as a class, as we give passive support to the governments to dictate to an even greater extent what happens with the resources that our class, the working class, creates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe outbreak of a hot phase of the war in Palestine has added to the general push towards war. Every day there is another warning about how this or that attack is threatening to turn the war there into a regional war. The tension between the countries reliant on Chinese dominated markets and finance on the one hand, and the US sphere of influence on the other is creating cracks in the global order. Ukraine was the first link in the chain to break, but the war in Palestine needs to be seen as another step in the same journey to barbarism and not as an isolated abnormality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the next few years, there will be more calls for war. Politicians and talking heads have been lining up to babble on about the need to bring back national service in the UK, how the UK military isn’t prepared for a war with Russia and that more money needs to be spent on buying weapons and military equipment. This might seem like a contradiction; at the same time that they are telling us that they don\u0026#8217;t have the ability to offer us anything beyond another pay cut, they are dusting off billions to pay for missiles and warplanes. In the end though it makes more sense for them to pump money into inhuman and destructive goals. There is a deep underlying economic crisis in slow motion across the world that is creating instability across the world economy, and war is a tried and tested method for governments and bosses to direct people’s anger away from the system that keeps them powerful, and toward some other group of governments and bosses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgainst the bosses’ logic of patriotism and industrial slaughter, workers in Italy have shown what international solidarity amongst the working class can look like. Dockers in Genoa refused to load cargo to ships that they suspected to be weapons. Recently, workers in India have refused to handle any materials that they believe are bound for the Israeli state’s war with Hamas, where over 30,000 people have been slaughtered in Gaza. Historically, workers’ refusal to participate brought an end to the first world war, with massive waves of strikes in Germany and a revolution in Russia brought down the imperial war machines on both sides. We need to create the kind of organisations that resist this pull toward militarisation locally and internationally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt might seem like we’re removed from these wars; there are no bombs falling in Bristol, but they are being made in Bristol. We’re encouraged to sit quietly while our national government allows and even encourages this slide towards global war. At the same time, workers are beginning to resist this. Health workers in the UK have formed groups in solidarity with health workers in Gaza, highlighting the connections between us and our brothers and sisters elsewhere and demonstrating that our interests are not aligned with those of the bosses and the government but in our common struggle against this inhuman system that throws the bodies of thousands of workers into the meat grinder to ensure that the profit keeps flowing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe NHS is made up of workers from all over the world with common problems and issues. We need to continue to fight against the attempts to create barriers between us, whether those are religious, ethnic or national, by job role, band, profession or union. We need to do this to create an example for the wider working class that our interests are not those of the national governments or the bosses who push them, but are in fighting for a new society without exploitation of our lives and work.\u003c/p\u003e\n"}},{"node":{"title":"Learning from health workers in Argentina – On the current rebellion in Neuquén","excerpt":"\u003cp\u003eWhat started as a health workers’ dispute has turned into a regional uprising.

Since early March, health workers throughout the province of Neuquén in Argentina have been staging unofficial strikes and roadblocks, demanding a pay rise higher than the miserable deal agreed by the government and the unions. They also demanding better working conditions to face what is expected to be the second wave of coronavirus in Argentina. The health system is not up to the task. Increased layoffs of critical care nurses and emergency paramedics over the past year have exacerbated staffing shortages. This dispute has turned into a bigger movement, and a self-organised one at that. Workers have been setting up a strike fund and holding open meetings at the hospital entrances. After being ignored, the movement has escalated their tactics by using roadblocks to obstruct the province’s oil and gas production.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"wordads-ad-wrapper\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"atatags-26942-851726\" data-adtags-width=\"740\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBackground of the dispute\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn December 2019, the provincial government froze public sector wages. This meant a 26% loss of purchasing power for health sector workers in the midst of the 2020 pandemic. The vaccination campaign, which began in early 2021, is slow to get off the ground while Argentina is caught up in the second wave of the pandemic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy has it kicked off now?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn February 24th this year, the provincial government offered a 12% wage increase to health workers. On February 25th, the union’s grassroots assemblies in about 20 hospitals and health centres rejected this proposal. Union General Secretary Carlos Quintriqueo ignored this vote, and on Feb. 26th, the union leadership accepted the government’s deal. This fierce betrayal of union (ATE) representatives was the straw that broke the camel’s back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn March 2nd, a large inter-hospital meeting of health workers was held in the centre of Neuquén, the provincial capital. They decided to demand that wage negotiations be resumed, a 40% increase for 2020 and an adjustment in line with inflation for 2021. They also decided to coordinate their demands with the teachers’ union, ATEN, and to draw up a joint action plan. ATEN had rejected the same wage proposal a few days earlier, and decided not to resume classes on March 3rd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, various conflicts were spreading in the region. Social movements blocked rural road bridges and other points for an increase in support programs; schools throughout the province made demands of the state; and the feminist movement took to the streets against the femicide of Guadalupe Curual in Villa La Angostura. On March 10th, self-organized health workers, opposition to the ATEN union leadership, other public sector workers, workers in the self-managed tile factories, and social movements came together in a demonstration that ended at the main government building. On March 12th, health workers with the union of justice workers (SEJUN) blocked the bridges between Neuquén and Cipolletti. Meanwhile, ATEN maintained a protest camp in front of the government building. There was still no response from the political side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn March 16th, the provincial government agreed to add 3% to the wage increase, for a total of 15%. At the same time, the health workers rehearsed a first blockade of the oil route, the roads through which the project of Vaca Muerta is carried out. (Vaca Muerta is an oil shale deposit where they’re fracking). The government continued to refuse to meet with the self-organized workers. ATEN’s union leadership pushed through the approval of the wage proposal, even though it meant a significant loss of wages. On the same day, the Cerámica Neuquén tile factory (which had been taken over by the workers*) was again threatened with eviction and auction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn March 24th, (the anniversary of the 1976 coup), thousands again took to the streets. In addition to the usual demands for commemoration, truth and justice, health was big on peoples’ agenda, demonstrating the broad legitimacy health workers now had amongst the wider population. More roadblocks, this time to famous tourist destinations, resulted in more clashes. The traffic chaos and growing criticism of a continued lack of response from the government emboldened health sector workers to expand their struggle further.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"wordads-ad-wrapper\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"atatags-26942-551511\" data-adtags-width=\"740\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOil and gas blockades\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Neuquén area is known for its oil and gas industry. On April 7th, a series of indefinite blockades began at strategic points along the oil route, focussing on Añelo, the neuralgic centre of Vaca Muerta. Through the roadblocks, workers have been mainly targeting the trucks transporting fuel from the Vaca Muerta refinery, while letting the rest of the drivers pass. The blockades have made it difficult to drill new wells, forcing the closure of smaller wells, and causing problems at processing plants that threaten Buenos Aires’ gas supply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the government continued its silence, the number of blockades increased to twelve by April 10th. For the last two weeks, 30 roadblocks have paralysed the activities of the petroleum industry in Vaca Muerta.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn parallel, a meeting was convened with social movements, unions, parties and local organizations in the city of Neuquén at the Castro Rendón Hospital, the largest hospital in the province. A few hours after this meeting, the state energy company of the province, EPEN, cut off the electricity to the worker-run Zanon-FaSinPat tile factory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first, the authorities had maintained that pay rise negotiations would only take place with the unions and refused to meet with the strikers. Finally, after weeks of unofficial actions, the provincial government agreed to meet the protestors but after a couple of meetings, which the workers considered unproductive and a waste of their time, they decided to leave the negotiation table until there was an acceptable pay rise proposal from the government.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e“We left our answer on the table and told them that we are not going to accept any more teasing, as they did yesterday (Friday 16th) when they kept us for 9 hours in sterile discussions. When they have a proposal for an increase in the basic pay, they can call us and we will sit down to discuss it. In the meantime we will continue to hold roadblocks and deepen the measures.”\u003c/em\u003e said one of the representatives of the workers, after last Saturday’s meeting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThroughout all this, the Mapuche communities in the Añelo area have been joining the pickets. The situation with the truck drivers has gone from conflicts and counter-pickets to solidarity. Workers have joined in solidarity and stayed outside the Ciudad Judicial where the negotiation meetings were held.\u003cbr /\u003e\nMeanwhile, almost all the union leaders not only do not support the strike but even openly attack it, like the leader of ATE Neuquén. The union leaders aligned with the Kirchner government, who went so far as to consider that it should be repressed, forcing all the sectional delegates to sign this declaration, which some of them denounced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the position of the union leaders, on the roads and in the streets of Neuquén, there is massive participation of health workers and massive support of teachers, as well as the active support of various militant unemployed movements. In addition, most of the oil workers and truck drivers appear to be getting closer to the health workers, despite the significant physical and monetary wear and tear that being stranded on the roads causes them on a daily basis. Some helped to block supply products for fracking, and have been maintaining food supplies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast week ended with a strike by the teachers’ union ATEN and the judiciary union SEJUN, which issued a joint statement with various unions at the Universidad del Comahue. It was a strike in solidarity with the health sector. The union leaders, under pressure from their own rank and file and large public support, could no longer stay out of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"wordads-ad-wrapper\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"atatags-26942-963534\" data-adtags-width=\"740\"\u003eIn a recent statement, the workers declared that: \u003cem\u003e¨(…) In the face of any offer from the government, it will be the assemblies of the hospitals and health centres, including the comrades who are on the different picket lines on the routes, who will decide whether to accept or reject it. If our rebellion was because a group of leaders decided on a miserable increase behind our backs, it will continue to be the rank and file who will decide the next steps. We call on the workers in each hospital and health centre to continue fighting for our decent pay and working conditions to continue in the front line of care for the population in this pandemic and the community to continue to support us.¨\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEffects of the uprising so far… \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe management tried to get oil workers to denounce health workers. Without success. The contractors complain about losses of millions. But the health workers’ struggle has also revealed that oil companies are raking in millions in profits every day. Another success of the ‘elephants’ (that’s what the health workers call their movement).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e“We work in conditions of overwork and overtiredness. We’ve had to maintain daily operations, with a lack of materials and rudimentary equipment.” Since early March 2021, the staff of the Centenario Hospital in the Argentine city of Neuquén has been on strike against planned austerity measures. The women are at the forefront of this. They are fighting against deteriorating working conditions and trying to make up for the loss of childcare in the pandemic. The offer made by Governor Gutiérrez on April 14 to pay a bonus of 30,000 pesos (270 euros) was rejected by the workers and they continue to strike, with energetic support from the public…”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://en.labournet.tv/strike-hospital-workers-neuquenargentina\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://en.labournet.tv/strike-hospital-workers-neuquenargentina\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n"}}]}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/posts/[slug]","query":{"slug":"the-experience-of-the-nurses-initiative-in-czech-republic"},"buildId":"SK0TuXb4ScjCeoqpPNyBT","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
