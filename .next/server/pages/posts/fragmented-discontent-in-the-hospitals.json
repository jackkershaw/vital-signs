Here at the University Hospital in Freiburg, our real-life experience hasn’t always fitted with this ‘reporting’. Where does this discrepancy come from? And why is there no ‘counter-narrative’ from our side? We came up with four possible reasons, which essentially revolve around the very different working conditions depending on where you work and the overall situation in the sector, which has not only been in upheaval since Corona. The following reports describe the situations in the Freiburg University Hospital and the Berlin Charité, at the time of Corona.</p>\n<div class=\"wordads-ad-wrapper\">\n<div id=\"atatags-26942-194877\" data-adtags-width=\"740\"><strong><em>There is a patchwork of wages – from pretty good to pretty bad!</em></strong></div>\n</div>\n<p>On a national level the average wages for registered nurses with three years of training in 2016 were between 3100 and 3500 euros gross without supplements. In 2021, the TVÖD (collective agreement for health workers in the public sector) is between 3050 and 3750 euros (career entry / highest level) – without shift/weekend supplements and without the new, albeit staggered nursing allowance. Since 2020, the collective agreement of the university hospitals in Baden-Württemberg has been higher: between 3300 and 4200 euros gross, including the new care allowance of 200 euros from 2020. The private players in the hospital sector are also taking the TVÖD as a benchmark in their group collective agreements, which took some tough battles to achieve. A gross salary of 3,000 euros for an entry-level employee is now the norm in the hospital sector. Wages in eastern Germany are still lower! Nurses for the elderly are on an average of 300-500 euros below this – if their company is not bound by a collective agreement, it is even less! The TVÖD covers about half of the hospital sector, i.e. about 500,000 colleagues. A fraction of the other half earn above the TVÖD, with the majority earning between 10 and 20 percent less. While the total workforce in hospitals has remained relatively constant between 1991 and today, the workforce in outpatient care services and inpatient (elderly) care facilities has risen sharply since the mid-1990s (since the introduction of the long-term care insurance!). The increase was most notable in the private-sector (i.e. profit-oriented) facilities.</p>\n<p>In nursing homes for the elderly and outpatient services, the TVÖD applies to less than ten percent of employees. The majority of approx. 800,000 colleagues have significantly lower wages. The wage differences are exacerbated by the fact that a lot of care work in nursing homes and outpatient services is done by unskilled or semi-skilled colleagues. The so-called ‘supplementary aids’ at Caritas and Diakonie do a lot of basic care in the outpatient services in addition to the house-keeping tasks, often at minimum wage. ‘Corona’ has led to people from the catering industry, for example, who have become unemployed, ending up in these jobs.</p>\n<p>It is not easy to say what a universally binding collective agreement would really have done for people working in the elderly care sector. But the labour law commission of Caritas (a major charity organisation) was remarkably open in its reasons for rejection: “The collective agreement relating to care for the elderly interferes with the structures of our AVR [collective bargaining guidelines of the employers attached to churches], e.g., in the wage adjustment between East-West or our differentiation of pay between daily companions/care workers, etc., and unskilled assistants. This problem could not be resolved.”</p>\n<p><strong><em>The workload is a patchwork – from okay to pretty crappy!</em></strong></p>\n<p>Since 1991, the number of beds in hospitals has decreased by a quarter; in the same period, the length of stay has halved from 14 to about 7 days and the number of cases has increased by a quarter. Meanwhile, the number of full-time employees in hospitals has risen by 50,000, but this figure includes significantly more doctors – at the expense of nursing staff. [1]</p>\n<p>There are two ways of reading these figures: Personnel planners and health insurers emphasize the lower numbers of beds and decrease in utilization, which is why they say that there hasn’t been a significant increase in workload. They do not ignore the increased number of cases, but see the solution in a ’focused revision’ of staff cuts, a further reduction in the number of beds, the expansion of outpatient care, an ‘optimization’ of the work processes (digitization!) and, last but not least, in an ‘adjustment’ of the ‘mix of different levels of qualification’ on the wards (this means: the academization of nursing and a deepening of the division of labour). [2]</p>\n<div class=\"wordads-ad-wrapper\">\n<div id=\"atatags-26942-326046\" data-adtags-width=\"740\">The counter calculation (e.g. by the union ver.di) sees clear evidence for a significant intensification of work in recent decades, based on the fact that overall numbers of cases have increased, the length of stay decreased and staff numbers have been cut under the ‘flat rate per case’ [Fallpauschale] system.</div>\n</div>\n<p>In our job, it is not easy to measure workload and work intensity in numbers. Nevertheless, it is possible to identify a few common indicators that might differ slightly between hospitals depending on their size, trust owner or financial resources. In private hospital groups, saving on personnel costs is part of the business model anyway. And in elderly care facilities, the personnel situation is even worse.</p>\n<p>– After the movement around the ‘care emergency’ at the end of the 1980s, a process of individualization set in. Many took advantage of the wage increases to go part-time; others took further training and specialized courses; quite a few studied nursing sciences and the like. With the restructuring that has taken place since the mid-1990s, many colleagues left jobs in hospitals and went into the expanding outpatient care sector.</p>\n<p>– The planners turned the demand for ‘better care’ into an enormous deepening of the division of labour on the wards by means of sub-stratification: internal transport services ‘freed’ us from taking patients beyond the ward boundaries (and thus cut communication, which had been so important for organization during the movement); services for meals and other work, warehouse workers supply the wards with materials, MTAs (medical-technical assistant) prepare medication or take blood samples.</p>\n<p>– So-called ‘patient managers’ or the ‘nurse in charge of patient processing’ (a professional category) take over the administrative functions – and are absent from the actual care work. The remaining nurses are relieved of ‘non-professional activities’, but have more stress in ‘areas of high responsibility’. Due to the shorter length of stay, patients on the ward are hardly ever fully independently mobile and the high-intensity work involved in admission, treatment and discharge increases.</p>\n<p>The workload changes from day to day and depends on many things: a stressful shift can be okay if you get the work done well with your colleagues; conversely, a shift that is actually chill can be crappy because the cooperation is not good, the doctors are in a bad mood again, the ward manager is annoying, your duty roster wishes have not been fulfilled, a colleague became ill at short notice, or you don’t get along with one patient or another…. Actually, all of these things are also reasons why many people are still in the job: Variety!</p>\n<p>But if you have no say in the process and the upper levels of the hierarchy can enforce everything, then it sucks. The disintegration of the ward teams through division and subdivision of labour have made it enormously difficult to resist together. Young colleagues are much more individualistic than they were 30 years ago. ‘Scandalization’ (portraying your general conditions as worse than they are, while accepting that management enforces smaller deteriorations), both toward colleagues and ‘to the outside world’, has become a necessary way to let off steam.</p>\n<p>For a sustained period of time, the divisions in terms of wages and working conditions and the widespread individualization prevented broad resistance. This changed in 2015 with the mobilizations and strikes for more nursing staff – but so far only in a relatively small number of hospitals. Spahn’s Ministry of Health has responded with regulations around minimum staffing levels and the outsourcing of care costs from the general case-based flat rates (‘nursing budget’), which contain the total costs of medical treatment. [3]</p>\n<div class=\"wordads-ad-wrapper\">\n<div id=\"atatags-26942-570456\" data-adtags-width=\"740\">In Freiburg, a 36-bed intensive care ward is now mostly staffed with 5/4/2 (early/late/night) registered nurses. In other hospitals, five registered nurses have to look after wards with 72 beds, even in the early shift.</div>\n</div>\n<p><strong>The whole place is in a state of upheaval</strong></p>\n<p>How many hospitals and beds will there be in the future, and how will this need be determined and implemented? And how will all of this be financed?</p>\n<p>‘Flat rates per case’ have been criticized ever since they came into existence. But they have also survived Corona, because there are strong interest groups that want to hold on to them (Spahn is one of them! if only because the standardised ‘flat rate’ allows him to gather data) – but no longer as the sole instrument of control to determine the finance of hospital care. [4]</p>\n<p>Beyond all the ideological debates, critics and proponents of ‘market control’ by means of ‘flat rates per case’ actually agree on the changes to the basic structure of hospital planning: the issue is the appropriate mix of local outpatient care and hospitals. Market supporters want ‘community nurses’, registered doctors / GPs (increasingly combined in medical care centres) and large clinics. ‘Leftists’ want a state-planned and financed mix of community care, outpatient clinics and hospitals, in imitation of the socialist past. Such discussions will only be exciting if movements of nurses or workers in general take them up!</p>\n<p><strong><em>‘Recognition’ or broad struggles? What should ‘nursing’ be?</em></strong></p>\n<p>The nurses’ movement in the late 1980s wanted ‘better care’, asking: what are we actually doing at work every day? With what ideas and ideals? Whose emergency is the ‘care emergency’: that of the patients or that of the nurses? Can these two perspectives be brought together? Does an ‘upgraded professional image’ also mean a better hospital? When we fight for more pay and better working conditions, are we also fighting against a society that makes people ill?</p>\n<p>These questions and contradictions are entangled together in the minds of colleagues as well as in many struggles and activities, and must be held together in this contradictory way so that they can be solved practically! They are then separated by the planners – and in the collective agreement of the union: For some of the ‘problems’ (and the colleagues!) there are improvements and mostly complicated regulations – the ‘rest’ is postponed (or was not even an issue). The (struggle for the) collective agreement is then not a starting point for further struggles, but puts an end to a mobilization. Or (the contract) even demobilizes, because many are disappointed by the results and can’t understand why it’s over again, when we were just starting having fun…</p>\n<p>To demand an ‘upgrading of care’ or ‘more recognition’ is a step backwards, compared to these initial questions and experiences. Quite a few colleagues parrot the trade unions’ slogans or say what the media like to hear. Yet we saw in the spring of 2020 how this is supposed to lull us. It is not possible to mobilize colleagues in this way; at best, it is enough for an online petition!</p>\n<p><strong><em>‘Welfare’ versus economization and market logic?</em></strong></p>\n<p>As an ideal collective body of capital, the state makes health reforms and buys ‘public health’ from the hospital; as a welfare state, it finances it and conducts ‘budget negotiations’ with the hospitals. The employees in the health care sector are also caught between social care and the economy, between providing for others and earning money. Only if our critique of the ‘white factory’ goes beyond criticizing the ‘assembly line care’ can we get out of this deadlock. The ‘white factory’, too, is in its core based on our cooperation and can therefore also mean ‘cooperate in order to fight together’!</p>\n<div class=\"wordads-ad-wrapper\">\n<div id=\"atatags-26942-692050\" data-adtags-width=\"740\">The so-called ‘relief collective bargaining agreements’ in about 15 larger hospitals were intended to reduce the burden on care staff. The first agreements were far too vague and quite complicated. They shifted the disputes to new institutions. Years ago, the colleagues in the Charité, a pioneering company, had emphasized: “The fight for implementation begins on the hospital ward.” But the jungle of rules and regulations has been stronger so far and killed off initiatives from below. The newer contracts (e.g. University Hospital Jena) are better. [5]</div>\n</div>\n<p>The business model of recent years (essentially: “do more with less staff”) has hit the wall: it showed its weaknesses in both moral terms and managerial terms (quality deficiencies, lack of staff) and, of course, was also weakened by incipient struggles. A university hospital in Baden-Württemberg has the economic fire-power to react to discontent and change the business model – whereas in Düsseldorf the colleagues had to strike for weeks (with participation of many professional groups) in order to change things. In addition, management uses the ‘relief collective agreements’ to streamline the work process: they introduce new shift-models and so-called flexi services (similar to bank shifts); they cut informal breaks that were previously paid for on night duty; they enforce the expansion of ‘on call’ agency work and other forms of flexible working. [6]</p>\n<p>The ‘relief agreements’ to date are the result of the first broad mobilizations in over 20 years. The campaigns were designed for a labour force that had long been passive, individualized, and fragmented by the restructuring of the work process. The union was able to plan in a way that conserved resources – important in the face of declining membership and uncertainty about risk and expense. So far, this has had the high price that the collective agreements apply predominantly only to trained nurses, affect only a few hospitals and thus run the risk of confirming the mentioned tendencies of re-dividing the total workforce (implementation of flexible working and the introduction of a deeper divisions of labour). Therefore, it will be important for people to have the experience of taking part in broad strikes, ‘after Corona’. During a strike the daily cooperation becomes visible – because otherwise it cannot be blocked. For this, connections with other workers must be built, divisions must be addressed and overcome. Striking by means of adhering only to the “Emergency Service Agreement”, is only half the battle. That type of strike saves money for the unions and provides predictability for the employer – but on our side, it’s only ‘half a battle’ fought. [7]</p>\n<p>It is not irrelevant whether improvements are achieved by strike or ‘negotiated’! Only in a strike we can gain experiences that will have an impact on how we work day in, day out – the power-relations, the divisions. Nurses have an objective strike problem: our ‘work material’ is people. We can only tackle this problem if we treat the ‘white factory’ as a factory; if we learn to stop working together and to deal with the consequences ourselves. [8]</p>\n<p>We will only be able to achieve an improvement in wage and working conditions for all if strikes are extended to more occupational groups and to other hospitals. Otherwise, we will remain stuck in a modernization process of the ‘white factory’ with increasingly fragmented working conditions and varied wages.</p>\n<p><strong><em>And yes, Corona was and is a challenge. The pandemic is a cross-border experience, and our struggles should not fall behind that, we should learn from each other. In mid-March 2021, workers in the British NHS protested against a paltry one percent pay increase offer from the government…</em></strong></p>\n<div class=\"wordads-ad-wrapper\">\n<div id=\"atatags-26942-592787\" data-adtags-width=\"740\"><strong>Freiburg, University Hospital</strong></div>\n</div>\n<p>In spring 2020, management reduced the schedule for planned surgeries pretty late, but at the same time they mobilized lot of extra staff: part-time workers were asked to increase their hours, students, trainees and ex-colleagues were called in, ‘old’ ventilators were dug out from the basement…. Many were quite excited about the new challenge.</p>\n<p>At the same time, there were some familiar problems: a completely non-transparent hierarchy from top to bottom, incomprehensible decisions and procedures – especially with regard to hygiene and testing strategies. Disputes about hygiene regulations are not new, we have been confronted with viruses and hospital germs for a long time, but the fact that we were affected as a whole sector, not (just) as individuals, was a new experience. The fact that you were suddenly looking after colleagues who had fallen ill made it clear to us, more than all the figures and information about the virus, that something new, ‘something dangerous’ was on the way. In the ‘first wave’, younger colleagues also fell ill, and are still complaining about the now familiar after-effects: sense of smell, nerve problems, difficulties with circulation/breathing. Because hygiene became much more a question of personal safety than before, many colleagues were annoyed that you never knew whether the hygiene rules were made according to a lack of PPE (‘limited resource management’) or actually for safety. Most colleagues would have acknowledged that a balance has to be found between safety and ensuring care – e.g. by means of a transparent testing strategy. But what was sold as a ‘testing strategy’ seemed to us more like flying blind. Patients in the emergency room were tested, fine. Those who were called in for surgery were also tested on admission – but then went through the entire procedure from the ward to surgery and back again before the result was in!</p>\n<p>In the case of outbreaks on the wards, the colleagues always had to strongly insist that half-consistent testing was carried out… There are no hard numbers of infected colleagues; if they have been tested by their family doctor, they do not appear in the company statistics. The ver.di personnel council drafted an ambitious paper with demands regarding occupational health and safety, but only a few colleagues found it on the intranet; there were no steps to implement it. Overall, there was a great deal of dissatisfaction – not because of staffing levels, but because of the ‘handling of the virus’, but it remained on the level of individual whining that never turned into something collective.</p>\n<p>One main difference between first and second wave was ‘staffing management’. Essentially, they surfed the ‘second wave’ with the normal staffing levels, without providing extra help. Staffing on the Covid wards was/is still quite good, but ‘around’ these wards people were struggling as staff were shifted onto the Covid wards. One of the Covid wards became an ‘infection cluster’ (20 colleagues of different professional groups were infected), which of course again reduced the staffing level. The intensive care units also had only normal staffing levels during the ‘second wave’. This was very stressful for weeks, since the Covid patients required a lot of work for a long period of time – the usual ups and downs of work load were missing. The fact that it still worked somehow was due to an old, very experienced and well-rehearsed core here in Freiburg, who put the brakes on ‘the young ones’ when they got hectic: “One thing at a time, an intensive care unit doesn’t work any other way!” The 2:1 staffing ratio could be maintained, but it became stressful because of hygiene measures when a colleague had to look after a covid and a non-covid patient. The occupancy rates finally started to decrease from mid-January onwards.</p>\n<div class=\"wordads-ad-wrapper\">\n<div id=\"atatags-26942-832229\" data-adtags-width=\"740\"><strong>Charité Berlin</strong></div>\n</div>\n<p>In spring there was some initial confusion as not enough PPE material was available; protective material and disinfectant disappeared from the freely accessible dispensers, as did soap, masks were missing on the ward, the FFPs were locked up and only issued with a signature. The Charité bosses talked of theft, and for a short time there were bag checks at the exits. Then, due to the scarcity, the instruction was issued to use an MNS-mask over the entire shift, including in break rooms. The hygiene officers added: FFPs were only necessary if an infected person coughed, or had to be intubated or suctioned. Fellow workers were all the more annoyed by the board’s assertion that colleagues were getting infected at home.</p>\n<p>In the spring of 2020, there had been a lot of extra personnel, trainees, students and volunteers used, and at times there were rather too many hands…. In the second wave, the wards were asked to provide staff for Covid wards (usually voluntarily), the teams were then smaller and were partly filled up with staff from temporarily closed wards. FFP masks were now standard. The hospital, however, tried to compensate for the financial losses of the spring, and only shut down the scheduled surgery program at a very late stage. Additional intensive care units (ICUs) had to be opened, and experienced ICU personnel were transferred to the new ICU areas. Together with nurses from the normal wards, ‘pairs’ were formed, a so-called ‘skill-mix’, in order to be able to look after the additional intensive care beds. The ICU staff in particular felt that this created additional stress.</p>\n<p>After shutting down/adjusting the surgery program, things quieted down on most of the other wards – but infections occurred again and again: Patients became symptomatic, or tested positive – along with one or two colleagues. There are no concrete figures, many have been tested by the family doctor and thus do not appear in the hospital statistics (which we also didn’t have access to). Currently, however, both the Covid infections reported in the Charité and the Covid infections reported via the health authorities are recorded (retrospectively) as occupational diseases.</p>\n<p>Starting in the autumn/winter of 2020, weekly swabs of patients became routine, with frequent positive results. During outbreaks, all the ward staff were also tested, which repeatedly led to wards being classified as ‘infection clusters’ and closed. At least one colleague was reported to have died without this becoming a broader issue in the clinic, as was the case with reports of deceased relatives following probable transmission of the virus from hospital to home.</p>\n<p>During spring 2020, there was definitely the sense that everyone was trying to get the situation under control. The cooperation between professional groups was more dynamic than usual. It was new for everyone, and you could learn something again. That’s all gone now. Political initiatives such as those of the Krankenhaus statt Fabrik (Hospital instead of Factory) initiative against ‘flat-rate payments per case’ or the current Zero Covid campaign haven’t really entered the wards. In 2016, we pushed through the first collective agreement that was supposed to bring more staff. There was a broad mobilization for this, but it ended up as a paper-pushing exercise about implementation of this or that regulation; the situation has improved in some wards, but not in others. The structures established at that time hardly exist anymore. Currently, ver.di is launching a new organizing effort with online general assemblies and campaigns geared to the upcoming elections in Berlin and at the federal level. It is not yet clear whether the Covid experience in the clinic will lead to new organizing attempts and struggles. The colleagues of the outsourced ‘service operations’ at CFM went on strike alone in 2020, ver.di ‘regretted’ after the arbitration in March 2021 that the outsourced workers were not going to be included in the Charité TVÖD (public sector collective agreement). Workers felt sold out…</p>\n<div class=\"wordads-ad-wrapper\">\n<div id=\"atatags-26942-405137\" data-adtags-width=\"740\"><strong>Oh yes, the Corona premium…….</strong></div>\n</div>\n<p>Towards the end of 2020, the debate around the Covid bonus also began in Freiburg. The federal state had increased the bonus to about 1.6 million, and with about 15,000 workers, there wouldn’t have been much left per person. In the end, 2,300 workers received between 350 and 1,500 euros. Very few would have minded if there had been no bonus at all. But many were annoyed by the confusing and unfair pay-out – “pay everyone an equal smaller sum, instead of such a chaos” – but again, there was no collective discussion about this.</p>\n<p>At the Charité in Berlin, there was a Corona bonus of in total 450 euros, paid over three months during the spring of 2020, which I believe was financed by the state of Berlin. In addition, there was a staggered payment of 300 to 600 euros in autumn 2020 through the TVÖD collective bargaining round. However, the new agreement signed by ver.di stipulates that there won’t be any wage increases until April 2021! The contract expired in September 2020, so there will be no increase for seven months! Or at least only for care staff via the premium – which is paid for by the federal government!</p>\n<p>Then the Charité hospital received money from the federal pot for the ‘first wave’; this was divided up according to an agreement with the sfaff council. Some people who didn’t receive any of this money went to the staff councils, but there wasn’t a collective debate around this either.</p>\n<p>——</p>\n<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p>\n<p>1 In 1991, there were a total of 875,816 ‘full-time positions’ of hospital workers (part-time positions were added up), 95,200 of whom were doctors, 780,600 general staff, about 45 percent of whom were nurses. In 2019, there will be a total of 928,000 ‘full- time equivalencies’, 168,000 doctors and 760,000 general staff. These shifts are in the logic of ‘per-case flat rates’: physicians bring in revenue, nurses cost.</p>\n<p>2 The nursing managers openly state that more staff on the wards, if it is not ‘targeted’, does not equal more quality and less workload. ‘Targeted’ then means new duty times and shift models in order to cover ‘workload peaks’.</p>\n<p>3 These lower limits are only an absolute minimum. Regardless of concrete struggles and ‘countervailing power’ in the hospital, management still has the ‘power over the numbers’ in all these new calculation methods, i.e. the possibility to control the work intensity through the flexible deployment of workers / the control of ‘patient flows’. Moreover, in all these calculations, the work of one specific occupational group is separated and calculated as if their work was independent from the total work on the ward, which politically consolidates the divisions of the last decades. And the discussion about a better basis for calculation only distracts from the struggle for better working conditions for all!</p>\n<p>4 In addition, so-called “’maintenance payments’ are to be added to finance that the ‘flat rate per case’ does not cover – such as the masks now during Corona.</p>\n<p>5 In Jena, shift-related staffing levels were defined for each station. In a three-year transition period, the clinic must pay workers bonus payments or give them extra holidays in case of non-compliance (this also means a jungle of documentation, complaints, proof, calling commissions….).</p>\n<p>6 In Freiburg, for example, the overlapping (handover) times between early and late duty have been halved. The young colleagues complain that no meaningful handover is possible anymore – and are then given extra training by management. The fact that this takes up any breathing space in the working day and increases the workload is overlooked.</p>\n<p>7 “Striking patients away”: strikes by means of “emergency service agreements”, obligated the employer to ‘empty’ those parts of the hospital that announced their intention to go on strike within a certain period of time (no more admissions, reduction of surgeries, transfer of patients…). Charité management had also signed this “emergency service agreement” because they had not expected such broad participation in the movement, which is an indication of what is possible.</p>\n<p>8 In October 2020, there was a five-day strike in Californian hospitals. Because Corona regulations prevented union organizers from entering, the strike had to be self-organized. The colleagues quickly agreed that it would only work if all workers joined in. A separate “emergency service” was set up for the patient areas in order to maintain the necessary minimum care work. Unfortunately, no real improvements have been achieved to date. This could also have been due to the fact that the focus was not on achieving material improvements in wages and working conditions, but on improving financing for the hospital. On this front, the hospital management reacted with new structures (trade unionists on the supervisory boards) and vague promises to reorganize financing.</p>\n"},"posts":{"edges":[{"node":{"title":"Issue no.1 – For workers’ and patients’ control of the health industry","excerpt":"<p>There are good reasons why we need more workers’ and patients’ control over the health system.</p>\n","slug":"issue-no-1-for-workers-and-patients-control-of-the-health-industry","date":"2024-05-11T17:43:57","featuredImage":{"node":{"sourceUrl":"https://vitalsignscontenteditor.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/20240205_092244-scaled.jpg","altText":""}},"author":{"node":{"name":"Angry Workers","firstName":"Angry","lastName":"Workers","avatar":null}},"pdf":{"pdf":null},"categories":{"edges":[{"node":{"name":"Debate"}}]},"tags":{"edges":[]},"content":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are good reasons why we need more workers’ and patients’ control over the health system. The pandemic was a prime example. We were able to see how disorganised the system is and how different players just followed their own interests. The national governments are pretty detached from the wider world of hospitals and labs. These same national governments are often in competition with each other, which is fatal if you have to react to global problems such as pandemics or climate change. The big private corporations that produce vaccines or PPE are also scattered, each just following their own goals. There were good people in medical science who had a critical view on the government plans, but they were powerless when it came to practical application and separate from the daily experiences on the wards. Hospitals didn’t coordinate effectively with the community and care homes, which was fatal in hundreds of cases. As part of the working class we, as health workers, were not united and conscious enough to provide society with an alternative pandemic plan. This will be our responsibility in the future.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We need more effective control. But this is easier said than done, because we are boxed into our separate professional groups and departments. Medical knowledge is not just unevenly distributed – it is often monopolised by elitist science and corporate patents. The health sector mirrors the problems of society at large. Some workers are caged into complex and specialist knowledge and run the risk of becoming blind to the wider context of their work, let’s say brain surgeons. The large majority of workers are caged into repetitive jobs where you hardly learn anything new. The potential creativity and productivity of billions of people is completely wasted for society!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are not brain surgeons; we are modestly skilled hospital workers, but with this series we’ll try to understand the development of two main sectors better. We work in local Bristol hospitals, but at the same time our work is closely intertwined with the global pharmaceutical industry and the device and implant industry. These industries connect the local, supposedly ‘public’ hospitals to the circuits of global development and money streams. For example, nearly one sixth of all annual hospital expenses, from wages to buildings, go straight to the pharmaceutical industry. In the case of one of the local hospitals that’s £150 million a year. Some of the private companies hire operation theatres and NHS staff for elective surgeries on weekends – at the Bristol Eye Hospital porters can make three times as much money on a ‘private’ shift compared to a regular shift. Some of the training for scrub nurses is provided by reps of global instrument manufacturers. Most NHS IT systems are run by global corporations, such as ATOS. The connections are endless.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a lot of journalistic material about these multi-billion industries, but journalism itself is a private industry and relies on ‘scandals’. And it is easy to find scandals in these industries, from hip implants that give people psychotic episodes due to cobalt poisoning, to the suffering of thousands of women who were given vaginal mesh implants or fallopian tube coils that had never been properly tested. It is important to hold the big corporations to account, but we also have to understand them from within, by reaching out to lab workers, surgeons, and science workers who have more insights than the journalist who looks for a good story. Yes, global medical corporations follow their own profit interest, but within these companies workers generate actual new knowledge. Most of them will get frustrated by the way that market goals limit the development of better medical technology. In academia as well, competition amongst medical researchers (which individual or which institution publishes more papers, gets more funding, etc.) prevents supportive cooperation and the development of a global human knowledge. We have to work together to break this human potential out of the tight shell of the corporate or academic boundaries. We need a counter-science where critical scientists, doctors, nurses, patients analyse new treatments together. We can see this slowly developing in other sectors, too, for example when tech workers at Google or Amazon start criticising the military or state surveillance use of their products or the impact on the climate. In some cases they link up with lesser skilled workers in the warehouses, which could give their critique a more powerful base.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our class, the working class, has produced an enormous wealth of medical knowledge and resources within the boundaries of the market and particularly during times of social change the working class movement has also managed to popularise more of that knowledge. In India in the 1970s and 1980s doctors left the elite hospitals in the major cities and travelled amongst the rural villages, helping to build peoples’ hospitals. In Italy in the 1970s a movement and psychiatrists and mental health patients questioned the repressive asylums and developed alternative ways to deal with psychological problems. In the 1970s midwives and mothers started to develop a new knowledge on birthing that was focused on the mother and the baby, not the medical vanity of the doctor. In Germany a movement of<a href=\"http://vdää* - Verein demokratischer Arzt*innen (vdaeae.de)\"> critical doctors</a> and health workers organised inquiries amongst chemical and other industrial workers, about hazardous substances and unhealthy working conditions &#8211; and they are still going strong. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> We can stand on the shoulders of previous generations of our class. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the upcoming issues we will make first baby steps towards an understanding of these two main industries – the pharma industry and the medical devices and implants industry within surgery. Our focus will be on questions such as: How is knowledge and technology developed? What are factors that facilitate and what are factors that hinder this development? What role does the market, competition, tight budgets, corporate goals play in all this? How does the hierarchical division of labour impact on knowledge development? How can alternative forms of equal cooperation emerge? We would like to speak to surgeons, lab technicians, pharmacists about their views and experiences.

We&#8217;re all stressed out, the good shifts are the ones that don&#8217;t leave us feeling like a zombie when we&#8217;re done. There&#8217;s never enough of us and there&#8217;s too many people that need us. It’s not just us workers who are beaten down, but the patients as well. We call our work care work, but how can we care for people when it feels like a factory that just needs to get people out the door as quickly as possible? We’re all aware of the problems, we’re the ones who deal with it day in and day out. Right now, a lot of the frustration with the way things are both at work and beyond is limited to individual moaning and bitchiness. It&#8217;s more likely to hear people blaming a “lazy” co-worker for their problems than the hospital managers, national NHS leaders, politicians.</p>\n<p>Even just across the NHS, there are 1.4 million of us working every day and night to make sure that society keeps running. We work in complicated connected ways, all of us relying on hundreds of others to provide care for the sick and innovate new ways to improve lives. We are like the backup motor of society, always running and always ready to take over when things go wrong. Because of this, we have a potential power as workers in an essential industry.</p>\n<p>For business as usual to carry on, the people in charge not only rely on the work that we do, but they rely on us doing it passively, never asking the question of whether things could be done differently. Individually, we stay weak and divided, but collectively we have a unique position: our work and collaboration ranges from hospital wards to medical labs, from operating theatres to medical science departments, from community surgeries to manufacturing sites for devices and implants. As united health workers we know about both social needs and technological developments and from this basis we can contribute to an alternative vision of a new human society: where we use knowledge and technology consciously for a better life for all, not for profits and wars.</p>\n<p>Vital Signs is an attempt by a group of workers across the two main hospitals in Bristol to give space to this perspective – you know the hospitals, one where the lifts never come and the other hospital dressed up as an airport with a £250,000 clock that nobody knows how to read. This magazine represents an effort to create a forum where together with co-workers we can reflect on our experiences, our struggles and our potential to create solidarity across bands, departments and professions. In this first issue we’ll introduce some of the key themes we want to explore.</p>\n<p>In &#8220;<strong><a href=\"https://www.vitalsignsmag.org/posts/issue-no-1-short-staffed-and-short-changed\">Short Staffed, Short Changed</a>&#8221; </strong>we’ve done interviews with co-workers in different jobs on the issue of short staffing, how it affects these workers and the general operation of the hospital. “<a href=\"https://www.vitalsignsmag.org/posts/issue-no-1-for-workers-and-patients-control-of-the-health-industry\"><b>For workers’ and patients’ control of the health industry</b></a>” looks at the way that medical and scientific knowledge is structured in the health industry. Normally this knowledge is kept separate from workers and patients, and we want to question that. We did an interview in <strong>“<a href=\"https://www.vitalsignsmag.org/posts/issue-no-1-bye-bye-dubai-hello-bedminster\">Bye Bye Dubai &#8211; Hello Bedminster!</a>”</strong> with a colleague involved in training nurses from abroad, which explores the messy exploitative way that the NHS pulls people in with grand promises and the reality when they get here. <strong>“<a href=\"https://www.vitalsignsmag.org/posts/issue-no-1-re-banding-or-banding-together\">Re-Banding or Banding Together</a>”</strong> is a conversation between two Health Care Assistants (HCAs) at different trusts about the campaigns to put HCAs up to Band 3. In <strong>“<a href=\"https://www.vitalsignsmag.org/posts/issue-no-1-against-the-global-trauma-ward-against-the-bosses-wars\">Against the Global Trauma Ward</a>”</strong> we look at how the wars going on around the world affect us and our struggles <strong>“<a href=\"https://www.vitalsignsmag.org/posts/issue-no-1-the-letting-game-letting-you-down\">The Letting Game &#8211; Letting You Down</a>”</strong> touches on the difficulties of renting in Bristol, and “<a href=\"https://www.vitalsignsmag.org/posts/issue-no-1-tears-sweat-and-placements\"><b>Tears, sweat and placements</b></a>” invites students working in the hospitals to engage with Vital Signs and reflect on their experience. We look at the local strikes since the big pay dispute a couple of years ago in <strong>“<a href=\"https://www.vitalsignsmag.org/posts/issue-no-1-minimum-wages-for-maximum-stress\">Minimum Wages for Maximum Stress</a>”</strong>, attempting to draw out some of the lessons we can learn from our colleagues on taking action. In the final article, <strong>“<a href=\"https://www.vitalsignsmag.org/posts/issue-no-1-hca-philosophy-for-a-new-relation-with-patients\">HCA Philosophy</a>”</strong> reflects on our relationship as workers to patients, and how sometimes the “professional” conduct we are encouraged into stops us from developing real human relationships across that divide.</p>\n<p>The following is an introduction to the project, its aims and its politics.</p>\n<p><em>Healthcare work after COVID</em></p>\n<p>Since 2019, the position of health workers in society has had a lot more focus on it. On the one hand, the Covid pandemic revealed the importance of our work particularly at a time of social crisis. We were celebrated as ‘key’ and ‘essential’ workers. We were called ‘heroes’. In this time, we took on a role of responsibility for society in general. On the other hand, only a year after the Covid crisis began to come under control, we began to push back across the NHS. When we turned around and demanded a pay increase, even just to claw back some of the pay that we have had cut over the last 15 years, the government and the bosses said that we were irresponsible or greedy. Because we weren’t united at the time, we weren’t in a position to struggle effectively. Different unions went after different pay offers, certain groups of workers went on strike at different times, and key issues like staffing levels and work stress were avoided by the official unions. Because there was a lack of worker and patient control over the hospitals and the wider NHS, the bosses and politicians were able to use the dividing lines that exist to stop our strikes from being effective. Now, only the junior doctors are still going on national strikes and the rest of us have gone back to work with nothing really having changed. We were sold bad pay deals below the level of inflation by the union head offices and hospital management. The questions that we want to ask are ‘what would it take to win?’, and more importantly ‘what are we fighting for?’</p>\n<p>The pandemic showed how much we need workers’ control of the industries that we work in. The response from governments and corporations was chaotic and contradictory with each pulling in different directions. In a lot of cases, workers had to enforce their own health and safety procedures on the bosses, because there was no plan in place and when they tried to implement things they didn’t understand the conditions of work. While massive parts of the workforce were either unable to work or working from home, workers in central industries were pushed to work for longer to make sure things kept running.</p>\n<p>We saw it in healthcare as well. There is a separation of the governments and the medical experts that they drafted in, and a further separation between those medical experts, the various self-interested medical corporations and the actual conditions on wards and in A&amp;E. Sense went out of the window over and over again. We deal with infectious diseases all the time and know what to do to prevent them, but if we went to the park on a weekend to meet up with a friend or to take the kids out of our garden-less flat, we’d be threatened with fines. Justified scepticism of the government was allowed to develop into conspiracy and anti-social ideologies. If we as health workers had been more united, we could have provided a basis for the rest of the working class to develop not only an understanding of the science and health concerns, but its own plan for dealing with the crisis – one that didn’t let thousands die in care homes, or in cold-storage warehouses. These crises will only become more frequent and more dangerous. Whether it is pandemics, economic, or climate based crises, we need to develop the unity and consciousness to design our own plans for society that don’t put our lives in the hands of abstract forces like the market and fiscal rules or detached politicians.</p>\n<p><em>Strikes and self-defence</em></p>\n<p>The strikes that happened over the last couple of years could have been an opportunity to begin building this unity and consciousness. For the first time in decades you had workers across job roles, professions and unions all taking an active stance to defend our pay and conditions. Instead, we allowed the government and the bosses to lean into the divisions that already exist. They played workers in England off against workers in Scotland and Wales by offering separate deals which meant that they were not part of the strike movement anymore. They tried to set junior doctors against nurses, nurses against HCAs and domestic etc. We didn’t have the connections to put up a fight against this. The unions let it happen. Even when each one was launching a pay claim, they all went for different demands! They didn’t even really want to work together. The bosses were able to use this against us and we ended up getting offered a bunch of crap deals. Inflation was at 14% for ages and we got offered 2%. We’re worse off now than we were even a couple of years ago. At the same time, the union headquarters wanted us to accept the crap deals. The online initiative NHS Say No organised by members of different unions was an impressive attempt to push back against the union bosses, but it wasn’t able to establish itself as a presence in many places. Because of this, issues of work stress and understaffing were only really raised as secondary issues in the big dispute, even when this is really what’s at the top of our agenda. Why are we having to work 12 hour shifts to make ends meet?</p>\n<p>We want this magazine to provide a bridge between workers with different skill sets, on the basis that we are all workers no matter what little cage the bosses try to put us in. Vital Signs is made up of workers from the lower rungs of the hospital hierarchy ladder, but we want to engage with workers from as many different sections of the hospital as possible. If we are going to prepare for the next wave of struggle, and prepare to win, we need to learn lessons wherever we can. We will look at history and at struggles of hospital workers in other countries like Germany, the US and Argentina to see what has been successful. We will try to make sense of different aspects of the medical science industry to gain a better understanding of the work that we do and how it relates to the wider system we live in. We want to investigate the health of working class people and give space for new relations between workers and patients, not always so sanitised in professionalism.</p>\n<p><em>Workers’ Control and Transition</em></p>\n<p>Vital Signs is an attempt by a group of workers across the two main hospitals in Bristol to challenge and overcome the problems that we face in our struggles. On top of this, we want the magazine to be a space where co-workers can begin to think seriously about the industry that we are in and what it would take to transform it, and run it. The political parties like Labour can’t be trusted, and the unions have their own interests. Any attempt to build working class power has to start from us, the workers ourselves. We have to develop our own organisations and institutions that we can use to direct our own struggles.</p>\n<p>As we have seen, in moments of crisis, governments rely on workers in industries such as ours &#8211; those that are essential to society functioning &#8211; to keep things running. In these moments of crisis, we have to be in a position to put forward an alternative vision and lead the struggle to achieve it. Collectively, we have extensive knowledge about running a huge cooperative project, we produce new knowledge and develop ways of doing things every day but as it exists the NHS is separated into hundreds of divided groups and these divisions limit our power.</p>\n<p>We are 1.4 million workers in the same industry, but how many of us know or understand the work of our co-workers? Does the nurse understand the problems that porters have to deal with at work? What do housekeepers know about what pharmacy assistants have to deal with and vice versa? This magazine will make attempts to break down these divisions, and allow us to look critically at the NHS and the wider system of global development that it is embedded in.</p>\n<p>If you’re interested in what you’ve read then get in touch!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"}},{"node":{"title":"Debate on the current character of hospitals and their restructuring","excerpt":"<p>Friends from France have written a detailed paper on the question – read it here. &nbsp;</p>\n","slug":"debate-on-the-current-character-of-hospitals-and-their-restructuring","date":"2024-05-09T12:02:13","featuredImage":{"node":{"sourceUrl":"https://vitalsignscontenteditor.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/images-1-1.jpg","altText":""}},"author":{"node":{"name":"Angry Workers","firstName":"Angry","lastName":"Workers","avatar":null}},"pdf":{"pdf":null},"categories":{"edges":[{"node":{"name":"Debate"}}]},"tags":{"edges":[]},"content":"<p>Friends from France have written a detailed paper on the question – read it <a href=\"https://mouvement-communiste.com/documents/MC/Booklets/BR6_Sant%C3%A9%20_EN_vF%20Site.pdf\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"}}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
