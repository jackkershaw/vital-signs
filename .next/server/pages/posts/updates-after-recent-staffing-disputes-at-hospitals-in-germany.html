Germany</h1></div></div></div></div><div class="max-w-2xl mx-auto"><div class="post-body_content__ye_eq"><p>Here in the UK, we’re looking at another gruelling effort to mobilise enough of our NHS co-workers to vote against the recent, government imposed wage cut. It would definitely be easier to motivate colleagues if the issue of pay was combined with the problem of stress at work due to chronic understaffing.</p>
<p>In Germany we have seen hospital workers going on strike over staffing levels – initially in the two biggest hospitals in Berlin, then more recently in six university clinics in North-Rhine Westphalia. The main demand of the strikers was to implement a new collective contract, which would guarantee hospital workers who work on understaffed shifts extra time off in compensation. Both series of strikes were successful in the sense that the day-to-day divisions between different wards and groups of workers in the hospital were undermined through collective action and that new staffing-related contracts could be introduced.</p>
<p>A few months after the strikes, however, the struggle to enforce the details of the contracts is continuing. As long as a collective mass of workers is on the move, management feels that they have to agree to changes. As soon as they only face a few union or works council negotiators, they think that they can go back on their word or find loopholes. Below you can find short updates from Berlin and from North Rhine Westfalia from September 2022.</p>
<p><strong>Berlin</strong></p>
<p>Hospital workers in Berlin went on strike for seven weeks to enforce a new contract. Now, nine months later, management is slow to implement the new staffing system. They’re finding loopholes and excuses, e.g. they claim that the development of software to record actual staffing levels takes a long time. As always the devil is in the detail. Management tries to exclude the handover time on understaffed shifts from the calculation of future compensatory time off. They built in traps, e.g. if a lead nurse, who normally has just a coordinating and advisory role, does not explicitly record that she isn’t engaging in bed care at the start of each shift, they will automatically be included as ‘care staff’.</p>
<p>Workers are also facing an increase in the chances of being moved around internally. If a ward is better staffed, people are moved around to wards where management would have to grant compensatory time off due to understaffing – the small margins to avoid having to compensate workers becomes the prime focus, not actual staffing shortages or care emergencies.</p>
<p>The management of the two hospitals also tries to undermine the future unity of workers. For example, anyone who works on their day off is supposed to be paid a significant bonus, but now groups of workers are excluded from this, such as imaging assistants. Management at one of the hospitals has recently offered a slight pay increase for 800 out of 2,100 workers, but workers who are newly hired for the same jobs will be paid less, which will introduce a two-tier workforce.</p>
<p><strong>North Rhine Westphalia</strong></p>
<p>In North-Rhine Westfalia, workers at six of the bigger university hospitals went on strike for eleven weeks during summer 2022. Apart from better staffing. workers demanded the end of the ‘flat-rate per patient’ system.This means that hospitals are not paid by the health insurance for the actual work they perform, but instead they receive a fixed amount of money for a specific intervention, e.g. in the case of a kidney operation, they are not paid for the actual (wo)men hours of an actual amount of staff, but a fixed amount for an ‘ideal’ operation.This system is supposed to create an incentive to save money by using less resources – which in the end means, making less workers work more, or focusing on the best paying treatments. As a result of previous protests, bed care has been excluded from this system, but workers in theatres and some other departments are still subjected to it. The strikes did not manage to abolish this division.</p>
<p>Another problem is that the newly-won terms allows management to take one and a half years to introduce the new staffing system. The union also compromised on other fronts. Admin workers, kitchen and transport workers and even ambulance staff are excluded from the compensatory staffing model. Management only offered a puny amount of additionally recruited staff for these hospital sections. This is particularly painful, because it was workers in these sections who massively supported the industrial action. The union also agreed to reduce the number of delegate workers who could take part in the negotiation process. Initially there were 60 worker delegates in the negotiating committee; this was reduced to 18 during the final process of negotiations.</p>
<p>While most workers agree that the strike brought them closer together and that the result is largely positive, it becomes clear that the struggle against divisions and against being ‘managed from the top’ continues! Hopefully we will be able to invite some fellow workers from Germany to a public zoom meeting soon where we can talk about their experiences during and after the industrial action – watch this space!</p>

in the UK, we’re looking at another gruelling effort to mobilise enough of our NHS co-workers to vote against the recent, government imposed wage cut. It would definitely be easier to motivate colleagues if the issue of pay was combined with the problem of stress at work due to chronic understaffing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Germany we have seen hospital workers going on strike over staffing levels – initially in the two biggest hospitals in Berlin, then more recently in six university clinics in North-Rhine Westphalia. The main demand of the strikers was to implement a new collective contract, which would guarantee hospital workers who work on understaffed shifts extra time off in compensation. Both series of strikes were successful in the sense that the day-to-day divisions between different wards and groups of workers in the hospital were undermined through collective action and that new staffing-related contracts could be introduced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few months after the strikes, however, the struggle to enforce the details of the contracts is continuing. As long as a collective mass of workers is on the move, management feels that they have to agree to changes. As soon as they only face a few union or works council negotiators, they think that they can go back on their word or find loopholes. Below you can find short updates from Berlin and from North Rhine Westfalia from September 2022.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBerlin\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHospital workers in Berlin went on strike for seven weeks to enforce a new contract. Now, nine months later, management is slow to implement the new staffing system. They’re finding loopholes and excuses, e.g. they claim that the development of software to record actual staffing levels takes a long time. As always the devil is in the detail. Management tries to exclude the handover time on understaffed shifts from the calculation of future compensatory time off. They built in traps, e.g. if a lead nurse, who normally has just a coordinating and advisory role, does not explicitly record that she isn’t engaging in bed care at the start of each shift, they will automatically be included as ‘care staff’.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorkers are also facing an increase in the chances of being moved around internally. If a ward is better staffed, people are moved around to wards where management would have to grant compensatory time off due to understaffing – the small margins to avoid having to compensate workers becomes the prime focus, not actual staffing shortages or care emergencies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe management of the two hospitals also tries to undermine the future unity of workers. For example, anyone who works on their day off is supposed to be paid a significant bonus, but now groups of workers are excluded from this, such as imaging assistants. Management at one of the hospitals has recently offered a slight pay increase for 800 out of 2,100 workers, but workers who are newly hired for the same jobs will be paid less, which will introduce a two-tier workforce.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNorth Rhine Westphalia\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn North-Rhine Westfalia, workers at six of the bigger university hospitals went on strike for eleven weeks during summer 2022. Apart from better staffing. workers demanded the end of the ‘flat-rate per patient’ system.This means that hospitals are not paid by the health insurance for the actual work they perform, but instead they receive a fixed amount of money for a specific intervention, e.g. in the case of a kidney operation, they are not paid for the actual (wo)men hours of an actual amount of staff, but a fixed amount for an ‘ideal’ operation.This system is supposed to create an incentive to save money by using less resources – which in the end means, making less workers work more, or focusing on the best paying treatments. As a result of previous protests, bed care has been excluded from this system, but workers in theatres and some other departments are still subjected to it. The strikes did not manage to abolish this division.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother problem is that the newly-won terms allows management to take one and a half years to introduce the new staffing system. The union also compromised on other fronts. Admin workers, kitchen and transport workers and even ambulance staff are excluded from the compensatory staffing model. Management only offered a puny amount of additionally recruited staff for these hospital sections. This is particularly painful, because it was workers in these sections who massively supported the industrial action. The union also agreed to reduce the number of delegate workers who could take part in the negotiation process. Initially there were 60 worker delegates in the negotiating committee; this was reduced to 18 during the final process of negotiations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile most workers agree that the strike brought them closer together and that the result is largely positive, it becomes clear that the struggle against divisions and against being ‘managed from the top’ continues! Hopefully we will be able to invite some fellow workers from Germany to a public zoom meeting soon where we can talk about their experiences during and after the industrial action – watch this space!\u003c/p\u003e\n"},"posts":{"edges":[{"node":{"title":"Learning from health workers in Argentina – On the current rebellion in Neuquén","excerpt":"\u003cp\u003eWhat started as a health workers’ dispute has turned into a regional uprising.

Since early March, health workers throughout the province of Neuquén in Argentina have been staging unofficial strikes and roadblocks, demanding a pay rise higher than the miserable deal agreed by the government and the unions. They also demanding better working conditions to face what is expected to be the second wave of coronavirus in Argentina. The health system is not up to the task. Increased layoffs of critical care nurses and emergency paramedics over the past year have exacerbated staffing shortages. This dispute has turned into a bigger movement, and a self-organised one at that. Workers have been setting up a strike fund and holding open meetings at the hospital entrances. After being ignored, the movement has escalated their tactics by using roadblocks to obstruct the province’s oil and gas production.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"wordads-ad-wrapper\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"atatags-26942-851726\" data-adtags-width=\"740\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBackground of the dispute\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn December 2019, the provincial government froze public sector wages. This meant a 26% loss of purchasing power for health sector workers in the midst of the 2020 pandemic. The vaccination campaign, which began in early 2021, is slow to get off the ground while Argentina is caught up in the second wave of the pandemic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy has it kicked off now?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn February 24th this year, the provincial government offered a 12% wage increase to health workers. On February 25th, the union’s grassroots assemblies in about 20 hospitals and health centres rejected this proposal. Union General Secretary Carlos Quintriqueo ignored this vote, and on Feb. 26th, the union leadership accepted the government’s deal. This fierce betrayal of union (ATE) representatives was the straw that broke the camel’s back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn March 2nd, a large inter-hospital meeting of health workers was held in the centre of Neuquén, the provincial capital. They decided to demand that wage negotiations be resumed, a 40% increase for 2020 and an adjustment in line with inflation for 2021. They also decided to coordinate their demands with the teachers’ union, ATEN, and to draw up a joint action plan. ATEN had rejected the same wage proposal a few days earlier, and decided not to resume classes on March 3rd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, various conflicts were spreading in the region. Social movements blocked rural road bridges and other points for an increase in support programs; schools throughout the province made demands of the state; and the feminist movement took to the streets against the femicide of Guadalupe Curual in Villa La Angostura. On March 10th, self-organized health workers, opposition to the ATEN union leadership, other public sector workers, workers in the self-managed tile factories, and social movements came together in a demonstration that ended at the main government building. On March 12th, health workers with the union of justice workers (SEJUN) blocked the bridges between Neuquén and Cipolletti. Meanwhile, ATEN maintained a protest camp in front of the government building. There was still no response from the political side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn March 16th, the provincial government agreed to add 3% to the wage increase, for a total of 15%. At the same time, the health workers rehearsed a first blockade of the oil route, the roads through which the project of Vaca Muerta is carried out. (Vaca Muerta is an oil shale deposit where they’re fracking). The government continued to refuse to meet with the self-organized workers. ATEN’s union leadership pushed through the approval of the wage proposal, even though it meant a significant loss of wages. On the same day, the Cerámica Neuquén tile factory (which had been taken over by the workers*) was again threatened with eviction and auction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn March 24th, (the anniversary of the 1976 coup), thousands again took to the streets. In addition to the usual demands for commemoration, truth and justice, health was big on peoples’ agenda, demonstrating the broad legitimacy health workers now had amongst the wider population. More roadblocks, this time to famous tourist destinations, resulted in more clashes. The traffic chaos and growing criticism of a continued lack of response from the government emboldened health sector workers to expand their struggle further.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"wordads-ad-wrapper\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"atatags-26942-551511\" data-adtags-width=\"740\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOil and gas blockades\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Neuquén area is known for its oil and gas industry. On April 7th, a series of indefinite blockades began at strategic points along the oil route, focussing on Añelo, the neuralgic centre of Vaca Muerta. Through the roadblocks, workers have been mainly targeting the trucks transporting fuel from the Vaca Muerta refinery, while letting the rest of the drivers pass. The blockades have made it difficult to drill new wells, forcing the closure of smaller wells, and causing problems at processing plants that threaten Buenos Aires’ gas supply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the government continued its silence, the number of blockades increased to twelve by April 10th. For the last two weeks, 30 roadblocks have paralysed the activities of the petroleum industry in Vaca Muerta.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn parallel, a meeting was convened with social movements, unions, parties and local organizations in the city of Neuquén at the Castro Rendón Hospital, the largest hospital in the province. A few hours after this meeting, the state energy company of the province, EPEN, cut off the electricity to the worker-run Zanon-FaSinPat tile factory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first, the authorities had maintained that pay rise negotiations would only take place with the unions and refused to meet with the strikers. Finally, after weeks of unofficial actions, the provincial government agreed to meet the protestors but after a couple of meetings, which the workers considered unproductive and a waste of their time, they decided to leave the negotiation table until there was an acceptable pay rise proposal from the government.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e“We left our answer on the table and told them that we are not going to accept any more teasing, as they did yesterday (Friday 16th) when they kept us for 9 hours in sterile discussions. When they have a proposal for an increase in the basic pay, they can call us and we will sit down to discuss it. In the meantime we will continue to hold roadblocks and deepen the measures.”\u003c/em\u003e said one of the representatives of the workers, after last Saturday’s meeting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThroughout all this, the Mapuche communities in the Añelo area have been joining the pickets. The situation with the truck drivers has gone from conflicts and counter-pickets to solidarity. Workers have joined in solidarity and stayed outside the Ciudad Judicial where the negotiation meetings were held.\u003cbr /\u003e\nMeanwhile, almost all the union leaders not only do not support the strike but even openly attack it, like the leader of ATE Neuquén. The union leaders aligned with the Kirchner government, who went so far as to consider that it should be repressed, forcing all the sectional delegates to sign this declaration, which some of them denounced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the position of the union leaders, on the roads and in the streets of Neuquén, there is massive participation of health workers and massive support of teachers, as well as the active support of various militant unemployed movements. In addition, most of the oil workers and truck drivers appear to be getting closer to the health workers, despite the significant physical and monetary wear and tear that being stranded on the roads causes them on a daily basis. Some helped to block supply products for fracking, and have been maintaining food supplies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast week ended with a strike by the teachers’ union ATEN and the judiciary union SEJUN, which issued a joint statement with various unions at the Universidad del Comahue. It was a strike in solidarity with the health sector. The union leaders, under pressure from their own rank and file and large public support, could no longer stay out of it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"wordads-ad-wrapper\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"atatags-26942-963534\" data-adtags-width=\"740\"\u003eIn a recent statement, the workers declared that: \u003cem\u003e¨(…) In the face of any offer from the government, it will be the assemblies of the hospitals and health centres, including the comrades who are on the different picket lines on the routes, who will decide whether to accept or reject it. If our rebellion was because a group of leaders decided on a miserable increase behind our backs, it will continue to be the rank and file who will decide the next steps. We call on the workers in each hospital and health centre to continue fighting for our decent pay and working conditions to continue in the front line of care for the population in this pandemic and the community to continue to support us.¨\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEffects of the uprising so far… \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe management tried to get oil workers to denounce health workers. Without success. The contractors complain about losses of millions. But the health workers’ struggle has also revealed that oil companies are raking in millions in profits every day. Another success of the ‘elephants’ (that’s what the health workers call their movement).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e“We work in conditions of overwork and overtiredness. We’ve had to maintain daily operations, with a lack of materials and rudimentary equipment.” Since early March 2021, the staff of the Centenario Hospital in the Argentine city of Neuquén has been on strike against planned austerity measures. The women are at the forefront of this. They are fighting against deteriorating working conditions and trying to make up for the loss of childcare in the pandemic. The offer made by Governor Gutiérrez on April 14 to pay a bonus of 30,000 pesos (270 euros) was rejected by the workers and they continue to strike, with energetic support from the public…”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://en.labournet.tv/strike-hospital-workers-neuquenargentina\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://en.labournet.tv/strike-hospital-workers-neuquenargentina\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n"}},{"node":{"title":"Paperwork nightmare – A creative way to strike by emergency services in Germany","excerpt":"\u003cp\u003eA form of labour dispute \u0026#8211; while the collective bargaining dispute was on paramedics refused to do the bureaucratic work that is necessary for the billing of services (e.g. with health insurance companies).\u003c/p\u003e\n","slug":"paperwork-nightmare-a-creative-way-to-strike-by-emergency-services-in-germany","date":"2024-05-07T14:19:28","featuredImage":{"node":{"sourceUrl":"https://vitalsignscontenteditor.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/kbl_tvoed.jpg","altText":""}},"author":{"node":{"name":"Angry Workers","firstName":"Angry","lastName":"Workers","avatar":{"url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a0f27e536deb935b37f956e7bad75489?s=96\u0026d=mm\u0026r=g"}}},"categories":{"edges":[{"node":{"name":"International"}}]},"tags":{"edges":[]},"content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eInterview with work council/trade union members\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Translated from: Express 5/2021)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a long time now, trade unions in personal services, care work, in hospitals as well as in day care centers and old people’s homes have been asking themselves the crucial question: How do you go on strike when other people depend on your work, or even when human lives depend on your own work?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt an ambulance service on the Swiss border, which is covered by the “DRK (German Red Cross) Reform Collective Agreement” negotiated between ver.di (service trade union) and DRK, the workers found a creative solution: They work, but while the collective bargaining dispute was on they refused to do the bureaucratic work that is necessary for the billing of services (e.g. with health insurance companies). Karin Zennig talked with two of the works council members involved in this “paperwork” or “billing strike”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eHow did you decide to go on paperwork strike? Why did you resort to this method and not walk out ‘normally?’\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMira: The idea came from ver.di. So far, the paperwork strike has only taken place within the emergency services. Since it is almost impossible to go on strike when you work in emergency rescue services, another method was sought to draw the employer’s attention to the grievances and to strike without suggesting to the population that human lives could be in danger. This is the best method for us. After all, we don’t want to harm the population by not manning a rescue vehicle, but to put pressure on the employer – so we work and are thus entitled to wages, but the employer doesn’t get any money from those who pay for the services. By the way, we now talk about ‘billing strike’ instead of paperwork strike, because we don’t want to give the impression that we are only ‘striking on paper’.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat are the important issues? What are you demanding?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDirk: In general, better wages, working hours and workplace arrangements. For example, it is always an issue that not all working hours are paid in the rescue service. Nationwide, it is common that for twelve hours worked, only 9.75 hours are paid. This means that every full-time employee in the rescue service works more than two hours ‘on a voluntary basis’ for every service each day. Under collective bargaining agreements, this is called ‘extended working time’ – legally, the employer thus circumvents the payment of ‘on-call time’, which would have to be considered working time according to rulings by the Federal Labor Court and the EU Court of Justice. For the first time in the 2018 collective bargaining dispute, we decided to go on a paperwork strike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eAnd how does such a ‘billing strike’ work?’ How is it different from a ‘normal strike?’ How much courage do you need to participate in a paperwork strike?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDirk: In a paperwork strike in the ambulance service, everything that concerns billing is omitted. Normally, after a rescue or emergency operation, the data of the operation (location, transport destination, crew) with the data of the patient (name, address, health insurance, etc.) are sent to the billing office. A so-called transport bill is enclosed for this purpose. This certificate confirms that the transport has been carried out and thus provides the basis for billing. However, this ‘office activity’ is not actually in the paramedic’s or ambulance crew’s original job description. To refuse to perform this activity means that insurers aren’t billed, therefore they don’t pay out, and the DRK doesn’t get reimbursed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMira: I don’t think it takes that much courage, it just takes everyone sticking together and participating. I think it would be harder to have a strike by not staffing a rescue operation than just not billing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eHow does the employer respond to that? What are their strategies?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDirk: The employers are always trying to stop industrial action with targeted intimidation. In the last but one round of collective bargaining, the employer openly communicated that in the event of a strike, payment claims against the striking workers could be expected and that everyone should think carefully about whether they would take this on themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMira: In a well-organised company, a paperwork strike like this can quickly cause tens of thousands of Euros in damage, and employers naturally don’t like that. Here it is always good and important that we know that our union is on our side and that it informs our colleagues about reaction strategies and our rights during a strike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eEven in a paperwork strike, it’s about acting together. How do you organise the collective momentum, which gives the individual the necessary courage? How do you arrange going on strike? Who knows when they do what and why?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMira: Yes, of course everyone has to participate. There are a lot of us in the union, so that’s not a problem. We do a lot of group chats and talk to each other personally. Everyone explains to the others what it’s about and how they feel about it. And when it’s not a pandemic, we meet with our union secretary and discuss what we need and how we can move forward together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eIs this method transferable to other areas? What positive or negative experiences with the strike and the organisation or reactions have you had with it that you would like to pass on to other colleagues?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDirk: You mustn’t lose sight of the fact that this method is the most effective in bringing employers to their knees. Since workers don’t stop work, they continue to be paid in full and all other operating expenses continue as well. But the incoming flow of money is interrupted. So, it’s possible that an employer is driven into bankruptcy quite quickly. Those most responsible for strikes, like union reps or shop stewards should, if in doubt, always keep an eye on this situation and intervene in time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMira: I’m just imagining, for example, if a waiter goes on strike by bringing the food to the guest, but never issues a bill afterwards. Well, our employer was not very pleased, neither by the strike nor by the actions themselves. They’ve been used to their employees never raising their voices for years, but they have been doing so more and more often and louder and louder in recent years. In my opinion, the employers are also dealing with this in the wrong way. They make us look as if we have outrageous demands instead of finally valuing these professions more. What is very positive and resonates far and wide is the cohesion amongst us and the feeling that we can achieve something together.\u003c/p\u003e\n"}},{"node":{"title":"“We don’t need applause, we need change!” – Interview with a striking nurse in Berlin","excerpt":"\u003cp\u003eOn the 23rd of August 2021, workers of the Berlin hospitals Charité and Vivantes went on a three-day warning strike.

In the near future we will try to write up further thoughts on the Berlin hospital strike, including a critical reflection on the trade union strategy, based on conversations with local health workers. You can read this article to understand the wider context. Despite various limitations, e.g. a strike participation of only around 20% (also due to legal emergency cover), we can still learn a lot from our fellow workers in Berlin – in preparation for future disputes here in the health sector in the UK.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eOriginal article \u003ca href=\"https://communaut.org/de/wir-brauchen-keinen-applaus-sondern-veraenderung\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e——\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIntroduction\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the 23rd of August 2021, workers of the Berlin hospitals Charité and Vivantes went on a three-day warning strike. The strike included the outsourced service workers at Vivantes. This was preceded by an ultimatum of 100 days, which the Berlin Hospital Movement (an alliance of initiatives and unions) had issued to the Senate (local government) and the employers of the state-owned hospitals on the 12th of May. The trade union demanded a serious offer concerning staffing levels, so-called ‘relief’, and pay and conditions according to the collective agreement for the public sector (TVöD) for all employees of the outsourced subsidiaries. The Senate and employers let the time pass unused – the health workers made good on their announcement and went on strike. Vivantes initially had the walkout banned by a temporary injunction from the labour court. The reason given: The medical care of patients was not secured because no emergency service agreement had been settled between Vivantes and Ver.di (the responsible trade union) in the run-up to the strike. However, the injunction was overturned a short time later at the labour court, and the walkout at Vivantes could begin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the meantime, it is clear that the strikes will continue. Today (6th of September 2021) Ver.di published the results of a strike ballot: about 98% of the union members at Charité and Vivantes voted for further work stoppages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese latest disputes continue a long-standing movement for more staff and relief at the hospitals. The struggles at Charité played a pioneering role in this (for the history, see the Ver.di brochure “If there are more of us it is better for all”). Following on from the Berlin experience, a movement for a collective ‘relief’ contract, which would allow for better staffing ratios, also formed in the region of Saarland from 2017 onwards. In these movements, strikes were held on the basis of emergency service agreements in which the employer was given responsibility for patient safety. Another novelty was the model of ‘collective bargaining advisors’ or team delegates. These delegates, which are supposed to be in close contact with the team nature of day-to-day work, should create a strong feedback loop between the collective bargaining process and the ran-and-file on the shop-floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe talked with Anja Voigt about the latest struggles. Anja is an intensive care nurse at Vivantes, involved in the Berlin alliance “Health not Profits”, Ver.di member and part of the collective bargaining commission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e———\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eCommunaut: Before you went on strike, you gave the senate and the employers a hundred-day ultimatum so that they would make you an offer for a collective agreements. Since there was no movement at all on their part, you now went on a three-day warning strike. How did you decide to use the ultimatum as a means of struggle?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur thought behind it was that the time was ripe for a renewed fight, since nursing and the hospital have received a certain amount of public attention through Corona. In addition, in September there is the election for the House of Representatives in Berlin. So the months from May to September were a good timeline to put pressure on politicians. If we simply stood up and demanded a collective agreement on relief, probably no one would have noticed. That’s why we tied the demand for a new collective agreement to an ultimatum, saying, “If serious negotiations don’t start by the end of the ultimatum, we’re going on strike.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eDid the idea of the ultimatum come more from the union side or from the workers?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe idea came more from the union, but really only the idea. A lot of colleagues were involved in the whole implementation, who in turn asked their colleagues: “Do we want to do this? Is this something that can bring us success?” The idea alone would not have been enough. When we asked our colleagues if they would take part in industrial action, they were beating down our doors. They were really up for it. The pressure on health workers is now so great and it’s clear to everyone that things can’t go on like this in Berlin’s hospitals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eDoes that mean that there is currently a high level of support for the demands and a high level of participation in the strike?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, there is a very high level of support. We started with a petition to find out whether our colleagues wanted to take part and whether the demands were important to them. More than 8,500 colleagues signed the petition. The approval of the demands for relief (better staffing levels) was also clear in the last TvöD (collective contract for the public sector) negotiations in October, when Ver.di asked what we would like to see negotiated. It emerged that many colleagues are no longer interested in a pay increase, but in more staff. More money is nice, of course, but it doesn’t solve the current problems. On the contrary, the current workload is causing more and more people to leave the nursing profession. In order to stop this, fundamental changes must finally be made.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eHow do you organise yourselves on the hospital level and, above all, between the various hospitals?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInitially I was unsure if a simultaneous struggle in two hospitals would work. I had doubts about whether it could work. Vivantes alone has nine different locations, the hospital campus is vast, while Charité has three large complexes. Nevertheless, we wanted to bundle our demands and develop a joint movement. I have to say, it’s working brilliantly. Social media are wonderful for such purposes, especially telegram channels, etc. We are much better networked today than we were during the collective bargaining disputes two years ago, which is really impressive. I suddenly know colleagues from the Benjamin Franklin Hospital or from Spandau with whom I had never been in contact before. Now we know each other and are aware of each other’s problems. The greater networking also leads to enormous cohesion between the colleagues, which of course also makes us stronger. I haven’t experienced that in recent years – and I’ve really been active in the union for a long time. A really strong movement has emerged. You can also see this in the fact that – albeit slowly – small success are becoming visible. We can move a lot due to the size that we have now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eIs your networking ‘only’ digital or do you also meet in person?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course we also meet in person. That’s very important for the exchange of ideas. But it’s striking how much easier communication has become thanks to social media: In the past, if there was something important to communicate that affected everyone, in the worst case we would write a newsletter. It would then be on the road for half a week until it reached the last area. Some people didn’t receive the information until 14 days later. Today, you send something to the telegram group and 5,000 people know about it immediately, which is a great relief and makes union work much more interesting for me, because you can reach so many people so quickly. That’s really fun.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eHow did you come up with your demands, is it more top-down? Are they Ver.di demands or do they come from below through your networking?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo, it’s not top-down at all, quite the opposite, it starts at the bottom. We have started – very laboriously – to talk to every single colleague. In their teams and on their wards, colleagues asked other colleagues. In this way, each colleague conducted a so-called demand interview, in which they were asked what their work situation was like, what was stressing them, what was needed to improve the situation, what was needed to reduce the workload, and how many staff would be needed to do a good job and to be able to care for patients well. We then gradually bundled the demands that were mentioned in the hundreds of interviews and used them to draw up systematic demands. Nothing was dictated from above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eFor some years now, Ver.di has had a system of team delegates for labour disputes, here in Berlin and beyond. Can you describe how this works? Do workers have more of a say vis-à-vis the union leadership than before? How do you see the relationship between union activists and Ver.di in general? Ver.di has not always covered itself with glory in the past – for example, during the Charité strike.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is now a very broad and democratic process. What I have just described with regard to the demands also applies to the feedback from the other side. You can think of it roughly like this: A ward has about one to three team delegates, depending on its size. On the one hand, these team delegates maintain the connection to the collective bargaining commission, i.e. directly to the main Ver.di office, and on the other hand they feed all the information back to their team. It is no longer just one person from each hospital building who sits on the collective bargaining committee and has to establish a flow of information to the entire workforce, but there is now a direct link between ward teams and the main office. For example, we have a meeting of the collective bargaining committee today and afterwards, at 5 p.m., there is a Zoom meeting with all team delegates from Vivantes and Charité. We then report to everyone what happened today and what we have planned. The team delegates then have the opportunity to give us feedback. So it’s not just a one-sided address from us and then the meeting is over. If the team delegates say they don’t agree with what we agreed to in the bargaining committee, then we don’t do that either. We don’t even make important decisions without this feedback.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis system of team delegates makes a lot of the female colleagues feel more involved. They no longer have the feeling: “Now we’re back to collective bargaining and Ver.di will say what’s going to happen, and then we’ll stand there with a flag and go on a warning strike and it’ll be fine.” Instead, they have the feeling that what is important to them also reaches the union and is negotiated directly. It’s about their needs and the needs of their patients on the ward. That’s what makes this movement so special.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eYou are currently fighting two battles at Vivantes at the same time: On the one hand, the nursing staff fights for the collective ‘relief’ agreement. On the other hand, the outsourced workers of the Vivantes subsidiaries fight for the integration into the collective agreement for the public sector (TVöD). How did you manage to combine the two struggles? That’s sometimes a difficult thing to do.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, that’s incredibly difficult, especially to make sure that the struggle remains simultaneous. But it was important to us from the very beginning to make clear that we are one hospital and that everyone in this hospital works together. That’s teamwork. The nurse is no better than the cleaner, the handyman or maintenance person no less important than the radiographer. Only together can we provide good patient care. It’s really special that we’ve managed to bring so many people with different demands along with us. At the moment, the nursing staff is fighting for a collective agreement to reduce the workload, the subsidiary workers would finally like to be paid fairly, and yet we are fighting together. We also hold joint collective bargaining committee meetings and exchange information together digitally. When the management of the subsidiary company comes up with a new offer to negotiate, we are invited to join in and discuss it: “You want to go on strike now, it doesn’t really suit us right now, but we can support you.” That’s always a very productive exchange. I find it very inspiring. It creates a close cohesion within the hospital. Suddenly you say hello to the cleaning staff early in the morning, who you didn’t even notice before. I also find it impressive that at the strike demonstration last week, colleagues spontaneously took to the stage and spoke in front of 1,000 people who no one else would have noticed. All of a sudden they are visible in their function and position.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eCan you assess how the willingness to fight has changed as a result of Corona? Have you noticed any changes compared to before?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis bad situation in the hospitals existed before Corona, of course, but it has become even worse, the workload has increased further. In addition, there is the factor that I mentioned earlier: We got more attention and publicity because of Corona. It makes the fight easier when you know that many people and the general public are behind us. I also believe that the willingness to fight has increased again as a result of the stupid applause. Many of us felt fooled by it and now say, “You can stop the nonsense, we really want a change now and now we’re going to do something.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eAt the Charité, and also at other public hospitals, the strikes of the past years were based on the regulation of a so-called emergency service agreement. This plays a relatively important role in the enforcement and organisation of strikes in hospitals, and in your case there has even been a court case. Can you explain what exactly an emergency service agreement is and how it comes about?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe concept of the emergency service agreement was first developed during the big Charité strike in 2015. Until then, there were virtually no strikes in hospitals. Maybe people from reception occasionally engaged in symbolic pickets but otherwise it was always said: “We can’t go on strike because our patients won’t be cared for.” This led to great frustration among hospital workers. As a result, the union at the Charité came up with the emergency service agreement system. With this agreement, the union gives the employer sufficient notice that they want to strike. The employer is then responsible for ensuring patient care. To put it bluntly, the emergency service agreement says to the employer: “We won’t be on the ward tomorrow morning, so make sure that there are fewer patients.” This makes it possible to delegate responsibility to the employer, which is why this emergency service agreement is so important. In the meantime, hundreds of such agreements have been concluded in many hospitals in Germany. In the meantime, however, it is no longer quite so easy to enforce. In the past, it was a matter of settling an emergency service agreement for three warning strike days. Today, and especially in Berlin, we are no longer talking about just three days. The employer also knows that and naturally says, “No, not with us.” It is no longer enough to simply indicate that we will walk out. There are now negotiations back and forth and in the end the employers don’t want to settle for an emergency service agreement. But then we go on strike anyway because it’s our right and we have an emergency service agreement in place that we abide by. This means that our patients are not at risk. This has now also been confirmed to us in court in the current dispute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eAt the beginning of this warning strike, Vivantes first managed to enforce a ban on strikes by means of a temporary injunction. What would you say was the strategy behind that?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe employer’s strategy was quite simply to prevent the strike. But it didn’t work; on the contrary, it backfired for Vivantes. During those three days, the willingness to fight grew even more because people were angry. The employer shot themselves in the foot, and I don’t think they expected this. We were proven right. It was also very important to many colleagues that we were not deprived of our basic rights just because we work in a hospital, but that it is clear that you can also strike responsibly in a hospital. It also annoys me in the public debate when people act as if we were irresponsible. None of my colleagues walks out, drops everything and we’re gone. We always check to see if someone else is there to do the necessary work. And we agree: “If you stay, I’ll go out, tomorrow we’ll do it the other way around.” That goes without saying. We took on so much responsibility in the Corona crisis, we didn’t run away. Of course, we won’t do the same in the event of a strike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhen the strike at Vivantes was hanging in the balance, did you discuss among yourselves what you would do to get around it if the strike ban remained in place?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first moment the order was announced, we were all shocked. Then we quickly regrouped and thought about what we would do now. It was clear to us very quickly that Vivantes would not be able to get this emergency injunction through. A judge had decided that in a rush, but we knew that we had a good emergency service agreement and that we would get justice in court. And with this conviction that we would win, we went to court and won.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe managing director of Vivantes, Johannes Danckert, likes to emphasise that he is also in favour of relief agreements, but that one hospital alone can’t do anything and that more money and, above all, political solutions are needed at the state or federal level. How would you answer him?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would tell him that he is absolutely right. The hospital financing system urgently needs to be reformed. Political solutions are needed, no question about it. We’re all with him on that, and we’ll also join him in the streets to demonstrate for that. But in the current situation, it’s up to Berlin’s state politicians, and we’re putting just as much pressure on them as we are on the management. We are always told by the management that they can’t decide anything and that the money has to come from politics. But we talk to them just as we talk to our management. As a city, as the capital of the Federal Republic of Germany, we have to think about whether we want to provide good services of general interest, healthcare that is fair to everyone, patients and employees alike. If you want that, then you have to spend money on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eNow there is an emergency service agreement. How many employees were ultimately able to take part in the warning strikes and demonstrations?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were 2,000 people at the strike demonstration on Wednesday. That was very impressive. There is still no emergency service agreement that Vivantes would have accepted. There is one that we say is good, that the employer could sign at any time – but they don’t, although it has also been confirmed in court. Nevertheless, many colleagues can go on strike with this emergency service agreement. I can’t give exact figures now, but certainly half of the colleagues were able to take part in the strike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eOnly nurses and other staff went on strike: what is your impression of the doctors? Do they support your demands and the strike?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt always depends on the level of the hierarchy. The assistant doctors, i.e. the medical colleagues who work directly with us, see our daily misery and therefore support the strike. There is even a medical petition that many doctors have signed – including chief physicians or senior physicians, i.e. people in management. They also know that they cannot fully occupy their beds because there are not enough nursing staff. They don’t often say this so openly because they are also under financial pressure and sit in management positions. One question that always gets me is why we don’t all get together, from the nurses to the head physician – or even the management – and put our foot down and say: “This simply can’t go on any longer. Something is financially sick in Germany’s hospitals.” We still have to get that together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eIn Berlin, there is also a lot going on, also outside of the hospitals. The railway workers, who also work in the public sector, have gone on strike; at the delivery service Gorillas, there were so-called wildcat strikes recently; there are protests against the expansion of the autobahn – are there mutual references and solidarity between these struggles?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, there are solidarities. Just a short while ago, we were at the AWO (charity and big care employer) workers’ strike with our collective bargaining committee. Colleagues from the GDL (train drivers union) visited our strike. We are networked among ourselves and there is support everywhere. Sometimes it seems to me that a lot is happening here this summer. In Berlin, people are setting out to fight for a better city.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eDuring the first Corona wave, there was a lot of talk about care work and the poor working conditions. Do you feel that there is more solidarity and understanding for your demands from society than during labour struggles before the pandemic?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my perception, people have always had understanding. They just could never understand how you can go on strike in a hospital. Many were afraid that we would simply leave the patients behind. I think something has actually changed. For example, when I was standing in front of the hospital’s strike picket during the warning strike, an elderly couple came up to me and said, “It’s right that you’re on strike, that’s a good thing. They canceled my X-ray appointment, but that’s just the way it is.” I have the impression that the population knows that something has to change. People also understand that they have to actively fight for change and can’t always just start a petition. They understand that sometimes you might have to confront people head on in order to change something. Then a medical appointment might have to be postponed sometimes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eNow you have carried out the warning strike. What do you think, will the hospital management come to the negotiating table? And will the workers vote for an indefinite strike in the ballot on Monday?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn any case, you can see that our pressure has been successful and that something is moving. In a meeting with Vivantes management today, they used the word “negotiation” for the first time. That’s more than they did three weeks ago. It’s still not concrete, because the management hasn’t made any proposals yet, but at least they are now signalling their willingness to sit down at the table with us. But we need to keep up the pressure. We can’t let up now, we have to step it up a notch if we really want to achieve a positive result. I am very sure that the ballot will be positive and I assume that around 90 percent will vote in favour of a strike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe demands that were at stake during the ultimatum and the strike concern collective bargaining issues. However, there are a number of demands that go beyond this, for example in the ‘Health not Profits’ alliance, in which you are also involved – such as the abolition of the fee-per-case system and your demand for a solidarity-based healthcare system without profit logic. What could such a healthcare system look like and what would have to happen for it to actually be implemented in practice?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere would have to be a different financing system. In the entire health sector, both in hospitals and in outpatient services, rehabilitation facilities, nursing homes, etc., the focus should not be on competition and profits, as is currently the case. No fire department, no school, no library has to make a profit, why then in the care of the sick? Something is ethically wrong. What is needed should be financed. If I’m sick, I need treatment, and that needs to be fully financed. The state must pay for this financing. We would not deny that it is also possible to work economically. But care must not be linked to whether an operation is particularly lucrative, and it should therefore not be prioritised over other cases. It cannot be the case that financial considerations determine how one is treated. We still have good medical care in Germany, but profit orientation absolutely must be abolished. Nor can taxpayers’ money and health insurance contributions be used to finance a system in which, in the end, some shareholders can pocket profits. That is crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eDo you think that such a health care system is possible within a capitalist society? Many people say that housing should not be a commodity – and why should food be a commodity? But in fact, almost everything around us is a commodity. Do you think that a needs-based supply is possible within this logic and that the state will simply step into the breach?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m quite sure of that, because that’s how it was in Germany until 2003. Until then, at least, the hospital financing system was not based on competition, but on need. Of course, there was a lot of corruption and abuse of power. But at least no hospital had to make a profit and be in the black. If the will is there, it is possible to turn this around again, perhaps not overnight, but as a trend. Even within the German Hospital Association (DKG), there are already such efforts. It is also clear to them that things can no longer go on as they are now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eAnother of the alliance’s demands is an equal distribution of care work between the sexes, whether private or professional, instead of cementing it as a task for women and families. Could you elaborate on what you mean by that exactly?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn our society, it’s clear who provides care: 70 percent of the people who work in hospitals are women. In the private sector, in the domestic care sector, their share is even higher. It is a task for society as a whole to rethink this. This starts on a small scale, for example with parental leave. How many men take parental leave these days? There are still very few, even though more and more are doing so. There needs to be a change in thinking, and society needs to promote the idea that caregiving tasks are shared equally and that it is not the sole task of women to provide care. Men can do that just as well. If care work is always shifted onto women, this leads to women working part-time because they are still caring for relatives, for example. Then they automatically earn less than men – an endless spiral that we have to get out of.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eYou are also fighting against the lack of autonomy at work and the hierarchical division of labor. What exactly does that mean and how would you like to organise work in care differently?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI can report from my own experience at work. It’s often the case that it’s not us, but the doctors who decide what needs to be done. It often happens that the doctor intervenes in my profession more than is reasonable. That is a problem, because I have learned the nursing profession and I can and want to determine independently what is good for the patient from a nursing point of view. In German hospitals, however, it is not at all common, or only to a very limited extent, for nurses to have a say in treatments or in questions of care. Too often, the focus is primarily on medical issues that the doctor orders and the nurse is supposed to carry out. If we are to achieve a better appreciation of our profession, it must end with others telling me what to do. Of course we should work together with the doctors, and in many cases this works very well. But we don’t need these hierarchies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn many hospitals, there is still only a medical director and an administrative director. Where are the nursing staff? We are the largest professional group in the hospital. Many hospitals now also have a nursing directorate with equal rights, but not everywhere yet. That urgently needs to change. To do that, we as nurses have to become even more self-confident. We really have to stand up and fight for this; we have let this happen to us for far too long.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eAre such ‘marginal’ topics, which are very important for developing self-confidence in everyday life, topics that you also discuss in the current dispute?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, they are topics. That’s why this alliance exists. We started with the demand for more staff in the hospital, but in the meantime we have gone much, much further. This feminist perspective has become much broader and bigger, but so have many other issues. They’re not always all equally present, but we’re always trying to focus on new issues as well. For example, we have also started to network more closely with the climate movement, because there are many points of contact there as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhen you’re at a demonstration with 2,000 people, are there also sometimes nurses who carry a self-made sign that says, for example, “Abolition of the hierarchy” or something similar?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYes, there are. This is becoming increasingly important, especially among younger colleagues. At the moment, the main topic is the need for more staff, but precisely because it’s about better working conditions, other issues always play a role as well. For many colleagues, it is an important question how self-confident and independent they can be in their profession. If I work in a profession where I’m always controlled by others, then at some point I get fed up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eFrom time to time, there are calls for hospitals to be taken back over by the local authorities, or the demand for ‘re-nationalisation’. Now we are dealing with public hospitals at Vivantes and Charité. Doesn’t the need to strike here, too, because working conditions are bad, make it clear that an even more radical change is needed – perhaps in the direction of a care revolution – in order to fight for a health care system based on solidarity?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn municipal – public hospitals, one already earns better – in Berlin, you are only paid according to the better standards of the TVöD if you work at Vivantes and Charité. So although our working conditions are poor, they are still better than those of our colleagues in other hospitals. I think that remunicipalisation is the right way to go. At the very least, all clinics should be run by non-profit organisations. Private clinics should be abolished, as they are only interested in making a profit – especially the large hospital operators such as Asklepios and Helios. Of course, we can think about a revolution and whether we need a market economy at all. But for now, I’ll start on a small scale, with our struggles.\u003c/p\u003e\n"}}]}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/posts/[slug]","query":{"slug":"updates-after-recent-staffing-disputes-at-hospitals-in-germany"},"buildId":"ODvijbe-NHj4YQXbDi-cy","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
