Germany</h1></div></div></div></div><div class="max-w-2xl mx-auto"><div class="post-body_content__ye_eq"><p>Here in the UK, we’re looking at another gruelling effort to mobilise enough of our NHS co-workers to vote against the recent, government imposed wage cut. It would definitely be easier to motivate colleagues if the issue of pay was combined with the problem of stress at work due to chronic understaffing.</p>
<p>In Germany we have seen hospital workers going on strike over staffing levels – initially in the two biggest hospitals in Berlin, then more recently in six university clinics in North-Rhine Westphalia. The main demand of the strikers was to implement a new collective contract, which would guarantee hospital workers who work on understaffed shifts extra time off in compensation. Both series of strikes were successful in the sense that the day-to-day divisions between different wards and groups of workers in the hospital were undermined through collective action and that new staffing-related contracts could be introduced.</p>
<p>A few months after the strikes, however, the struggle to enforce the details of the contracts is continuing. As long as a collective mass of workers is on the move, management feels that they have to agree to changes. As soon as they only face a few union or works council negotiators, they think that they can go back on their word or find loopholes. Below you can find short updates from Berlin and from North Rhine Westfalia from September 2022.</p>
<p><strong>Berlin</strong></p>
<p>Hospital workers in Berlin went on strike for seven weeks to enforce a new contract. Now, nine months later, management is slow to implement the new staffing system. They’re finding loopholes and excuses, e.g. they claim that the development of software to record actual staffing levels takes a long time. As always the devil is in the detail. Management tries to exclude the handover time on understaffed shifts from the calculation of future compensatory time off. They built in traps, e.g. if a lead nurse, who normally has just a coordinating and advisory role, does not explicitly record that she isn’t engaging in bed care at the start of each shift, they will automatically be included as ‘care staff’.</p>
<p>Workers are also facing an increase in the chances of being moved around internally. If a ward is better staffed, people are moved around to wards where management would have to grant compensatory time off due to understaffing – the small margins to avoid having to compensate workers becomes the prime focus, not actual staffing shortages or care emergencies.</p>
<p>The management of the two hospitals also tries to undermine the future unity of workers. For example, anyone who works on their day off is supposed to be paid a significant bonus, but now groups of workers are excluded from this, such as imaging assistants. Management at one of the hospitals has recently offered a slight pay increase for 800 out of 2,100 workers, but workers who are newly hired for the same jobs will be paid less, which will introduce a two-tier workforce.</p>
<p><strong>North Rhine Westphalia</strong></p>
<p>In North-Rhine Westfalia, workers at six of the bigger university hospitals went on strike for eleven weeks during summer 2022. Apart from better staffing. workers demanded the end of the ‘flat-rate per patient’ system.This means that hospitals are not paid by the health insurance for the actual work they perform, but instead they receive a fixed amount of money for a specific intervention, e.g. in the case of a kidney operation, they are not paid for the actual (wo)men hours of an actual amount of staff, but a fixed amount for an ‘ideal’ operation.This system is supposed to create an incentive to save money by using less resources – which in the end means, making less workers work more, or focusing on the best paying treatments. As a result of previous protests, bed care has been excluded from this system, but workers in theatres and some other departments are still subjected to it. The strikes did not manage to abolish this division.</p>
<p>Another problem is that the newly-won terms allows management to take one and a half years to introduce the new staffing system. The union also compromised on other fronts. Admin workers, kitchen and transport workers and even ambulance staff are excluded from the compensatory staffing model. Management only offered a puny amount of additionally recruited staff for these hospital sections. This is particularly painful, because it was workers in these sections who massively supported the industrial action. The union also agreed to reduce the number of delegate workers who could take part in the negotiation process. Initially there were 60 worker delegates in the negotiating committee; this was reduced to 18 during the final process of negotiations.</p>
<p>While most workers agree that the strike brought them closer together and that the result is largely positive, it becomes clear that the struggle against divisions and against being ‘managed from the top’ continues! Hopefully we will be able to invite some fellow workers from Germany to a public zoom meeting soon where we can talk about their experiences during and after the industrial action – watch this space!</p>

UK, we’re looking at another gruelling effort to mobilise enough of our NHS co-workers to vote against the recent, government imposed wage cut. It would definitely be easier to motivate colleagues if the issue of pay was combined with the problem of stress at work due to chronic understaffing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Germany we have seen hospital workers going on strike over staffing levels – initially in the two biggest hospitals in Berlin, then more recently in six university clinics in North-Rhine Westphalia. The main demand of the strikers was to implement a new collective contract, which would guarantee hospital workers who work on understaffed shifts extra time off in compensation. Both series of strikes were successful in the sense that the day-to-day divisions between different wards and groups of workers in the hospital were undermined through collective action and that new staffing-related contracts could be introduced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA few months after the strikes, however, the struggle to enforce the details of the contracts is continuing. As long as a collective mass of workers is on the move, management feels that they have to agree to changes. As soon as they only face a few union or works council negotiators, they think that they can go back on their word or find loopholes. Below you can find short updates from Berlin and from North Rhine Westfalia from September 2022.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBerlin\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHospital workers in Berlin went on strike for seven weeks to enforce a new contract. Now, nine months later, management is slow to implement the new staffing system. They’re finding loopholes and excuses, e.g. they claim that the development of software to record actual staffing levels takes a long time. As always the devil is in the detail. Management tries to exclude the handover time on understaffed shifts from the calculation of future compensatory time off. They built in traps, e.g. if a lead nurse, who normally has just a coordinating and advisory role, does not explicitly record that she isn’t engaging in bed care at the start of each shift, they will automatically be included as ‘care staff’.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorkers are also facing an increase in the chances of being moved around internally. If a ward is better staffed, people are moved around to wards where management would have to grant compensatory time off due to understaffing – the small margins to avoid having to compensate workers becomes the prime focus, not actual staffing shortages or care emergencies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe management of the two hospitals also tries to undermine the future unity of workers. For example, anyone who works on their day off is supposed to be paid a significant bonus, but now groups of workers are excluded from this, such as imaging assistants. Management at one of the hospitals has recently offered a slight pay increase for 800 out of 2,100 workers, but workers who are newly hired for the same jobs will be paid less, which will introduce a two-tier workforce.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNorth Rhine Westphalia\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn North-Rhine Westfalia, workers at six of the bigger university hospitals went on strike for eleven weeks during summer 2022. Apart from better staffing. workers demanded the end of the ‘flat-rate per patient’ system.This means that hospitals are not paid by the health insurance for the actual work they perform, but instead they receive a fixed amount of money for a specific intervention, e.g. in the case of a kidney operation, they are not paid for the actual (wo)men hours of an actual amount of staff, but a fixed amount for an ‘ideal’ operation.This system is supposed to create an incentive to save money by using less resources – which in the end means, making less workers work more, or focusing on the best paying treatments. As a result of previous protests, bed care has been excluded from this system, but workers in theatres and some other departments are still subjected to it. The strikes did not manage to abolish this division.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother problem is that the newly-won terms allows management to take one and a half years to introduce the new staffing system. The union also compromised on other fronts. Admin workers, kitchen and transport workers and even ambulance staff are excluded from the compensatory staffing model. Management only offered a puny amount of additionally recruited staff for these hospital sections. This is particularly painful, because it was workers in these sections who massively supported the industrial action. The union also agreed to reduce the number of delegate workers who could take part in the negotiation process. Initially there were 60 worker delegates in the negotiating committee; this was reduced to 18 during the final process of negotiations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile most workers agree that the strike brought them closer together and that the result is largely positive, it becomes clear that the struggle against divisions and against being ‘managed from the top’ continues! Hopefully we will be able to invite some fellow workers from Germany to a public zoom meeting soon where we can talk about their experiences during and after the industrial action – watch this space!\u003c/p\u003e\n"},"posts":{"edges":[{"node":{"title":"Speech by an apprentice health worker at the ‘Walk of Care’ in Berlin","excerpt":"\u003cp\u003eWe document a speech by an apprentice care worker held at a recent \u0026#8216;Walk of Care\u0026#8217; in Berlin.\u003c/p\u003e\n","slug":"speech-by-an-apprentice-health-worker-at-the-walk-of-care-in-berlin","date":"2024-06-04T08:56:27","featuredImage":{"node":{"sourceUrl":"https://vitalsignscontenteditor.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_20240514_173343_6071281.jpg","altText":""}},"author":{"node":{"name":"Angry Workers","firstName":"Angry","lastName":"Workers","avatar":null}},"pdf":{"pdf":null},"categories":{"edges":[{"node":{"name":"International"}}]},"tags":{"edges":[]},"content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eWe document a speech by an apprentice care worker held at a recent \u0026#8216;Walk of Care\u0026#8217; in Berlin. The \u0026#8216;Walk of Care\u0026#8217; emerged out of a series of meetings of health and care workers in Berlin. For several years now, they have been organising regular protests against shortcomings in the care sector. This year the protests were joined by midwives, physios, critical medical students and patients. Amongst other things, they demanded a general and free health service that meets the needs of the patients, a 30-hour week for health workers, and a living wage for relatives and friends who care for their next of kin.

But when the system is geared toward profit maximisation, this unfortunately gets in the way of our aims. In this case we are just supposed to restore people\u0026#8217;s labour power (meaning,  the physical and mental minimum to go to work) or, if their ability to work has been exhausted, to accompany them to death.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eAn economic system that is geared towards the maximisation of profits has no interest in caring for people: it seeks efficiency. An economic system focused on making more and more money creates jobs in which the interests of the workers are always worth less than the profit that can be made from them. Profit has always come before human lives, and we experience that very directly.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eWe experience the importance of our work for patients and the community. But we currently cannot influence the wider conditions of our labour. Nursing work increasingly takes place in an environment characterised by financial cuts, overtime, discrimination between “profitable” and “unprofitable” patients, and the exploitation of immigrant workers and women in particular. At the same time, cutbacks jeopardise psychological and social services and health care for vulnerable and highly marginalised groups in society. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eThese conditions mean that care workers, patients and people in need of care face precariousness. Staff shortages and constant work overload lead to psychological suffering, exhaustion, and fear of causing harm or making mistakes. As care workers, we experience daily that we are unable to meet our expectations and do justice to our patients. When there is hardly any time for humane care, the dehumanisation of patients is the protective reaction of many care workers. Getting through the shift is the order of the day. Often, professional nursing workers only stay in their profession for a few years after their training.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eWe must fight so that our work is not reduced to a series of interventions and measures around the sick body. Other futures are possible: community-oriented and/or self-managed care that develops ideas of health and care through its practice, based on the needs and interests of the communities with which it interacts directly. We must be prepared to challenge and resist the limitations of our roles and of the institutional structures that govern our practice. Our autonomy is important if we are to provide dignified care that is not hindered by the over-regulation and economisation of the health and care sector.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eLet us build more just and collaborative relationships. By reducing power imbalances we can improve care practice. Solidarity among colleagues is paramount: let us engage with colleagues and healthcare professionals from other specialties or settings. Dialogue between different social groups is also important: we must nurture relationships between patients, staff, friends and family in order to create a permanent state of solidarity and support in the healthcare institutions.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eThe numerous recent protest actions have shown that the system is sustained through us. Without nursing, it would not work. However, it is not enough to improve staffing. Nor is it enough to denounce the injustices of our work environment. We need to defend our interests as workers and patients. And we know that we have a better chance of asserting our interests if we join forces, form majorities and develop power through collective processes, commitments and solidarity. The time has come to enforce fundamental changes ourselves. Let us begin to fight within the care sector for a self-determined society and turn illness into a weapon.\u0026#8221;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n"}},{"node":{"title":"Issue no.1 – Against the global trauma ward!

The RAF is dropping bombs on Yemen. It\u0026#8217;s not much of a revelation to say that war is bad, but why do we think it\u0026#8217;s important to talk about it here? Do we really need more bad news about war? The truth is that, against the general narrative, war isn’t something that just affects those people miles away. Instead, the impact is felt across the whole of our society and involves all of us. Over the next 10 years, the Government has committed to spending an extra £230 billion on weapons and military equipment, while the NHS is told to tighten its belt and more and more of it are auctioned to the highest bidder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeriods of crisis, economic or otherwise, have historically been a precursor to war. The competition over markets and territory when things get tough creates tensions between countries that inevitably boil over into conflict in a search for domination over land and labour. These conflicts are justified by calls for “patriotism” in service of the “national interest”, always only a thin veil over the call for a working class massacre. After all, it’s never the politicians who fight the wars. They leave that to us, our brothers and our sisters, the working class.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2022, after the Covid pandemic, the impacts of the war on supply chains and government finances contributed heavily to the inflation crisis that was felt across the world. In a direct way, the war was used as an excuse by governments and employers to attack the pay and conditions of workers across the world. During the strikes in the NHS, when we were pushing back against these attacks, we were accused of “serving the interests of Putin” by politicians. When faced with crises such as war, national governments double down on simplistic stories about ‘us vs them’ and ‘good vs evil’, to lean into nationalist feelings. They do this to disguise the fact that in wars between nations, the interests of workers are not the same as ‘our’ governments and corporations. They paint an imaginary picture which falls apart at the first interaction with reality. This ideology of nationalism is just a blatant attempt to create false divisions within the working class, pushing us to line up behind one group of rulers or another. This puts us in a weaker position as a class, as we give passive support to the governments to dictate to an even greater extent what happens with the resources that our class, the working class, creates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe outbreak of a hot phase of the war in Palestine has added to the general push towards war. Every day there is another warning about how this or that attack is threatening to turn the war there into a regional war. The tension between the countries reliant on Chinese dominated markets and finance on the one hand, and the US sphere of influence on the other is creating cracks in the global order. Ukraine was the first link in the chain to break, but the war in Palestine needs to be seen as another step in the same journey to barbarism and not as an isolated abnormality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the next few years, there will be more calls for war. Politicians and talking heads have been lining up to babble on about the need to bring back national service in the UK, how the UK military isn’t prepared for a war with Russia and that more money needs to be spent on buying weapons and military equipment. This might seem like a contradiction; at the same time that they are telling us that they don\u0026#8217;t have the ability to offer us anything beyond another pay cut, they are dusting off billions to pay for missiles and warplanes. In the end though it makes more sense for them to pump money into inhuman and destructive goals. There is a deep underlying economic crisis in slow motion across the world that is creating instability across the world economy, and war is a tried and tested method for governments and bosses to direct people’s anger away from the system that keeps them powerful, and toward some other group of governments and bosses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgainst the bosses’ logic of patriotism and industrial slaughter, workers in Italy have shown what international solidarity amongst the working class can look like. Dockers in Genoa refused to load cargo to ships that they suspected to be weapons. Recently, workers in India have refused to handle any materials that they believe are bound for the Israeli state’s war with Hamas, where over 30,000 people have been slaughtered in Gaza. Historically, workers’ refusal to participate brought an end to the first world war, with massive waves of strikes in Germany and a revolution in Russia brought down the imperial war machines on both sides. We need to create the kind of organisations that resist this pull toward militarisation locally and internationally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt might seem like we’re removed from these wars; there are no bombs falling in Bristol, but they are being made in Bristol. We’re encouraged to sit quietly while our national government allows and even encourages this slide towards global war. At the same time, workers are beginning to resist this. Health workers in the UK have formed groups in solidarity with health workers in Gaza, highlighting the connections between us and our brothers and sisters elsewhere and demonstrating that our interests are not aligned with those of the bosses and the government but in our common struggle against this inhuman system that throws the bodies of thousands of workers into the meat grinder to ensure that the profit keeps flowing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe NHS is made up of workers from all over the world with common problems and issues. We need to continue to fight against the attempts to create barriers between us, whether those are religious, ethnic or national, by job role, band, profession or union. We need to do this to create an example for the wider working class that our interests are not those of the national governments or the bosses who push them, but are in fighting for a new society without exploitation of our lives and work.\u003c/p\u003e\n"}},{"node":{"title":"Learning from health workers in Argentina – On the current rebellion in Neuquén","excerpt":"\u003cp\u003eWhat started as a health workers’ dispute has turned into a regional uprising.

Since early March, health workers throughout the province of Neuquén in Argentina have been staging unofficial strikes and roadblocks, demanding a pay rise higher than the miserable deal agreed by the government and the unions. They also demanding better working conditions to face what is expected to be the second wave of coronavirus in Argentina. The health system is not up to the task. Increased layoffs of critical care nurses and emergency paramedics over the past year have exacerbated staffing shortages. This dispute has turned into a bigger movement, and a self-organised one at that. Workers have been setting up a strike fund and holding open meetings at the hospital entrances. After being ignored, the movement has escalated their tactics by using roadblocks to obstruct the province’s oil and gas production.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"wordads-ad-wrapper\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"atatags-26942-851726\" data-adtags-width=\"740\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBackground of the dispute\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn December 2019, the provincial government froze public sector wages. This meant a 26% loss of purchasing power for health sector workers in the midst of the 2020 pandemic. The vaccination campaign, which began in early 2021, is slow to get off the ground while Argentina is caught up in the second wave of the pandemic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy has it kicked off now?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn February 24th this year, the provincial government offered a 12% wage increase to health workers. On February 25th, the union’s grassroots assemblies in about 20 hospitals and health centres rejected this proposal. Union General Secretary Carlos Quintriqueo ignored this vote, and on Feb. 26th, the union leadership accepted the government’s deal. This fierce betrayal of union (ATE) representatives was the straw that broke the camel’s back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn March 2nd, a large inter-hospital meeting of health workers was held in the centre of Neuquén, the provincial capital. They decided to demand that wage negotiations be resumed, a 40% increase for 2020 and an adjustment in line with inflation for 2021. They also decided to coordinate their demands with the teachers’ union, ATEN, and to draw up a joint action plan. ATEN had rejected the same wage proposal a few days earlier, and decided not to resume classes on March 3rd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, various conflicts were spreading in the region. Social movements blocked rural road bridges and other points for an increase in support programs; schools throughout the province made demands of the state; and the feminist movement took to the streets against the femicide of Guadalupe Curual in Villa La Angostura. On March 10th, self-organized health workers, opposition to the ATEN union leadership, other public sector workers, workers in the self-managed tile factories, and social movements came together in a demonstration that ended at the main government building. On March 12th, health workers with the union of justice workers (SEJUN) blocked the bridges between Neuquén and Cipolletti. Meanwhile, ATEN maintained a protest camp in front of the government building. There was still no response from the political side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn March 16th, the provincial government agreed to add 3% to the wage increase, for a total of 15%. At the same time, the health workers rehearsed a first blockade of the oil route, the roads through which the project of Vaca Muerta is carried out. (Vaca Muerta is an oil shale deposit where they’re fracking). The government continued to refuse to meet with the self-organized workers. ATEN’s union leadership pushed through the approval of the wage proposal, even though it meant a significant loss of wages. On the same day, the Cerámica Neuquén tile factory (which had been taken over by the workers*) was again threatened with eviction and auction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn March 24th, (the anniversary of the 1976 coup), thousands again took to the streets. In addition to the usual demands for commemoration, truth and justice, health was big on peoples’ agenda, demonstrating the broad legitimacy health workers now had amongst the wider population. More roadblocks, this time to famous tourist destinations, resulted in more clashes. The traffic chaos and growing criticism of a continued lack of response from the government emboldened health sector workers to expand their struggle further.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"wordads-ad-wrapper\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"atatags-26942-551511\" data-adtags-width=\"740\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOil and gas blockades\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Neuquén area is known for its oil and gas industry. On April 7th, a series of indefinite blockades began at strategic points along the oil route, focussing on Añelo, the neuralgic centre of Vaca Muerta. Through the roadblocks, workers have been mainly targeting the trucks transporting fuel from the Vaca Muerta refinery, while letting the rest of the drivers pass. The blockades have made it difficult to drill new wells, forcing the closure of smaller wells, and causing problems at processing plants that threaten Buenos Aires’ gas supply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the government continued its silence, the number of blockades increased to twelve by April 10th. For the last two weeks, 30 roadblocks have paralysed the activities of the petroleum industry in Vaca Muerta.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn parallel, a meeting was convened with social movements, unions, parties and local organizations in the city of Neuquén at the Castro Rendón Hospital, the largest hospital in the province. A few hours after this meeting, the state energy company of the province, EPEN, cut off the electricity to the worker-run Zanon-FaSinPat tile factory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first, the authorities had maintained that pay rise negotiations would only take place with the unions and refused to meet with the strikers. Finally, after weeks of unofficial actions, the provincial government agreed to meet the protestors but after a couple of meetings, which the workers considered unproductive and a waste of their time, they decided to leave the negotiation table until there was an acceptable pay rise proposal from the government.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e“We left our answer on the table and told them that we are not going to accept any more teasing, as they did yesterday (Friday 16th) when they kept us for 9 hours in sterile discussions. When they have a proposal for an increase in the basic pay, they can call us and we will sit down to discuss it. In the meantime we will continue to hold roadblocks and deepen the measures.”\u003c/em\u003e said one of the representatives of the workers, after last Saturday’s meeting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThroughout all this, the Mapuche communities in the Añelo area have been joining the pickets. The situation with the truck drivers has gone from conflicts and counter-pickets to solidarity. Workers have joined in solidarity and stayed outside the Ciudad Judicial where the negotiation meetings were held.\u003cbr /\u003e\nMeanwhile, almost all the union leaders not only do not support the strike but even openly attack it, like the leader of ATE Neuquén. The union leaders aligned with the Kirchner government, who went so far as to consider that it should be repressed, forcing all the sectional delegates to sign this declaration, which some of them denounced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the position of the union leaders, on the roads and in the streets of Neuquén, there is massive participation of health workers and massive support of teachers, as well as the active support of various militant unemployed movements. In addition, most of the oil workers and truck drivers appear to be getting closer to the health workers, despite the significant physical and monetary wear and tear that being stranded on the roads causes them on a daily basis. Some helped to block supply products for fracking, and have been maintaining food supplies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast week ended with a strike by the teachers’ union ATEN and the judiciary union SEJUN, which issued a joint statement with various unions at the Universidad del Comahue. It was a strike in solidarity with the health sector.
