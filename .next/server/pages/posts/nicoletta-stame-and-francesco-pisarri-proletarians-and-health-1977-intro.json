Francesco Pisarri (1946) is a medical doctor and has worked at the university hospital. They both participated in the ‘Centro stampa comunista di Roma’.</p>\n<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>\n<p>1. This book documents an inquiry into a recent struggle that expressed some of the most significant ideas that our movement has developed: it is about a struggle against class medicine and for the proletarian management of a hospital in which the workers on the Policlinico Umberto I in Rome have been involved in since 1971.</p>\n<p>Even though there has been a lot written about this dispute in the local media, there are only a few comrades who know what actually happened at the Policlinico. This struggle has bothered plenty of people: the authorities of the government, of the regional administration, of the university and hospital hierarchy, the barons of the university and the clinic bosses, the directors of the pharmaceutical industry, as well as the communist party PCI and the trade unions; everyone of them, each according to the role they play, haven’t missed any opportunity to accuse the workers (branded as ‘extremists’, ‘provocateurs’, ‘slackers’ – depending on the case) and to confuse the public opinion about the real significance of the struggle. Even many comrades were influenced by this big deployment of bourgeois propaganda. This is why we feel the need to understand what has moved the workers to become active and to analyse their actions.</p>\n<p>As soon as we approached the comrades who led the struggle, the main principles of their initiative became apparent: we were facing one of those rare cases in which the proletarians themselves lead a struggle for health without delegating this neither to the official organisations of the left nor to the progressive bourgeois technicians. By basing itself on those who expressed the most ‘radical’ needs (“<em>To be radical is to grasp things by the root. But for man the root is man himself.</em>”) [1] and by relating the particularity of the ‘medical oppression’ constantly to the general proletarian condition in our society, they managed to develop a mass line which became the stronghold of workers and patients united against the barons of medicine [2], their common enemy, and to snatch from the latter – apart from important victories – also the mask of power.</p>\n<p>Another significant reason for the achieved successes of their initiative, together with various subjective and objective factors that we try to explain in this book, was the capacity that the workers who were organised in the Workers’ Collective of the Policlinico developed to engage in continued inquiries into their own situation, into the relations of production to which they are subjected to and into the mass needs. They made use of these inquiries to verify their political line and as a stimulus for the conscious participation of the masses in transformative action. Rejecting revisionist politics that tries to make workers believe that the ideas of the bourgeoisie are their own ideas, the workers made an effort to clarify which are their own ideas, their own needs, their own reasons in order to make them the basis of their own politics.</p>\n<p>2. It seems that in order to study these experiences we need to develop instruments of political inquiry to be able to grasp the anti-capitalist and anti-revisionist significance that the masses have given their struggle.</p>\n<p>We know how difficult it is for workers in a, what is usually defined as, ‘mass society’ to develop their own ideas, to break through the smoke screen that is created by all those who speak of ‘the masses’, who engage in research ‘into the masses’ or act ‘in the name of the masses’. We also know that amongst comrades of intellectual or petit-bourgeois background, who constitute a fair share of our organised movement and who don’t have a deeper knowledge about the way of life and thought of the popular masses, the revisionist ideas which seem to stem from inside the masses themselves (whereas actually they are formulated within the official ‘workers’ organisations), and therefore seem to be the most progressive, are also the ones that spread most easily. It is therefore a pressing task to clarify also for ourselves which are these revisionist ideas that we intended to contest with our inquiry.</p>\n<p>A first idea relates to the property relations within the health service, which is divided into a public and a private sector. The revisionists maintain that the struggle against the medical barons, who are representative of a clientelist, mafia-like and parasitic power, can only try to subordinate the private sector to public management with the desire to reform the latter; as a result we would have an ‘efficient’, ‘rational’ and ‘modern’ system that would solve all our problems. In this way you don’t question the class contradictions that emerge from within the labour process [processo produttivo] and the class interest of the workers is confused with ‘public management’ of the institutions; and most importantly, you don’t manage to clearly recognise the new public ‘regime’ of property as the enemy of the masses.</p>\n<p>A second revisionist idea, which is related to the first, states that within the health service you cannot struggle without harming the patients, unlike in the manufacturing sectors of goods, where the struggle harms the bosses. This argument is based on a willful mystification: the workers who are excluded from exercising any power when it comes to the management of the public institutions (because they would not have the ‘expertise’ or ‘capacity’) are at the same time considered to be the only ones that are responsible when it comes to the functionality of the service. If you don’t understand that the struggle for health has to attack the class relations that develop within the labour process of the health sector, you will inevitably end up pandering to the interests of those who actually dominate these relations entirely (who certainly are not the sick ‘users’).</p>\n<p>A third revisionist idea claims that if the general interest is to obtain reforms that put the health service under public management then the sole task of the workers becomes to strengthen the trade union that fights for this policy. In this way, “anyone who is against the trade union is either a fascist or an infiltrator”, or at least a “corporatist”. This is the idea that has perhaps the strongest influence amongst many comrades, who might agree with the arguments of the previous two assumptions, but who think that the trade union is the “historical organisation of the working class” and that if you don’t want to detach yourself from the masses it is necessary to avoid detaching yourself from the union. In this way, many of these comrades who have approached the struggle ended up with the following judgement: “the workers fought a just fight as long as they were combatting the bosses, but once they became sectarian towards the trade union, they could only end up remaining isolated”.</p>\n<p>In a preliminary way these are the interpretations of the situation that we are opposing. [3] Even if we often repeat that the masses are the real heroes, that without the masses we are nothing, very little is actually done to put the masses – the scientific analysis of their ideas, of their capacity to comprehend the reality that surrounds them – at the centre of the elaboration of a political line. This means that little is done to confront the class contradictions and the division of manual and intellectual labour on which the capitalist society thrives. Consequently there is a persistent tendency within the political line of our movement to have an open flank for revisionism.</p>\n<p>To become aware of the necessity to combat this tendency meant realising that also in our case it is not enough to simply preach that “who doesn’t engage in inquiry has no right to speak” in order to obtain a correct style of working [4], but that it becomes a moment in the struggle between opposed political lines. [5]</p>\n<p>We therefore propose to follow the workers in their process of forming a consciousness of the various aspects of hospital reality (from the first struggles in small groups to the big mass struggles and beyond) in order to understand how class relations develop in concrete terms within the hospital and in which conditions it is possible to enforce a proletarian class position in the struggle for health.</p>\n<p>3. But things don’t become any easier once we have decided to put the masses at the centre of our inquiry. It is necessary to grasp the complexity of their situation from at least two points of view. Firstly, the popular masses cannot be understood outside of the contradictory relations that they have with the social classes that dominate them. Secondly, within the popular masses there exist diverse opinions, advanced and backward elements, revolutionary layers and attachments to the old society, and it is not possible to focus on only one of these aspects. If we are not aware of these problems it is easy to fall into the trap of unilateral analysis.</p>\n<p>A prime error of this type is, for example, to only see the revolutionary moment of the masses, the most developed point of their consciousness, and thereby to forget that the conditions of exploitation and oppression in which the masses exist undergo a process of ‘conditioning’ of the proletariat to the rules of this system. This ‘conditioning’ is part of the ‘conditions’ which the proletariat has to take into account in order to develop its own struggle. [6] Therefore, it is necessary to understand that victories over the enemy can only be obtained through heavy battles also within our own camp, and that in the situation that follows, a new (instable) equilibrium of oppression/subordination is created which requires to prepare ourselves for fighting again and on a different plane. [7]</p>\n<p>At this point it is also possible to commit the opposite error, which is to focus only on the contribution that all parties who are involved in the health system (both oppressed and oppressors) make for its ‘functioning’ in relation to a goal that is imposed by those in power (a goal that could be the strengthening of the power of the medical barons, the increase of the profits of the multinationals, the expansion of the public sector or even solely the creation of a sphere of consensus with the rules of the system) and the workers (as the ‘instruments’ that keep the system running). If it is true that the barons and the upper hierarchy of the hospital have managed to install a system of domination that reproduces itself on the various levels of hierarchy and that shapes the entire institution within which it exercises its power, then it is also necessary to remember that the equilibrium on which the system seems to rest is only a surface appearance, the straight-jacket of the relation of production, which the struggle of the oppressed aim to break. [8]</p>\n<p>This conception of the social relations in the hospital, which considers the tendency towards equilibrium as primary and the struggle as secondary, can end up subsuming the mass movement to a bourgeois direction and leadership. This is, in fact, the ideological expression of a very active social strata, of democratic medical professionals. They actually are in a leading position within the struggle against the medical barons, but don’t recognise that pushing towards a proletarian leadership of the struggle for health is the coherent consequence of the negation of one’s own role as a medical professional. [9]</p>\n<p>If the democratic medical professionals affirm that “medicine is a form of power” and that in the field of health, capital develops its political-scientific apparatus in opposition to the masses, then they cannot fight this power without without putting themselves at the service of the movement of those who have suffered this oppression up to now. If the latter don’t become active subjects in the overthrow of the baron’s medical system by using all means at their disposal (which includes the necessary alliance with the ‘specialist’ comrades), the demystification from above would end up privileging the intellectual elements of the struggle – meaning, the small and middle-bourgeoisie – and being reduced to a simple change of leadership over the ‘inert’ masses of manual workers.</p>\n<p>On the other hand the proletariat – in order to be not only the engine, but also the leading element of the struggle – needs to know the relations of power in a concrete sense and the various points of disequilibrium that can tip the current balance of power.</p>\n<p>With the political inquiry moving towards deeper levels, the overt stability of the system, once seen from its fundament, turns out to be a rather precarious equilibrium: what seems on the surface level as the power of the barons reveals itself to have plenty of cracks, because the weakness and impotence of the masses, and their underlying radical needs, can transform themselves into critical capacity, in a movement to “overturn the current state of things”.</p>\n<p>It is by grasping this complex set of conditions that the proletariat can develop the strength of their autonomy and the initiative of their struggle.</p>\n<p>Adorno, one of the sharpest critic of the ‘totalitarianism of the system’, scolds the Marxists of today for never asking the question: “how subjects who have been conditioned in such a way (the proletarians in a situation of social impotence and alienation imposed by monopolistic capital) could be capable of an action (the revolution) that does not only require intelligence, a common vision and presence of spirit, but also an capacity of extreme abnegation”. [10] The question contains a challenge and is infused with scepticism. We think that the best answer that one can give to this question is the following: situations exist in which the proletariat has proven to possess such qualities, and we have studied one of such situations. Now we have to understand its basis, its ways, its effects and prospects. This is what we propose with this book.</p>\n<p>4. It seems that the questions that are at the centre of the struggle for autonomy led by the workers of the university clinic can be summarised in this way.</p>\n<p>a) Workers are the material basis of everything that happens inside the hospital: they perform the heavy and dangerous tasks that the doctors don’t want to do (tasks that capital considers as ‘less important’ in relation to those which require a high degree of ‘specialisation’), and also tasks of great responsibility, such as the continuous care for patients, which requires a presence of spirit in the moment of need, capacity of initiative etc.. Furthermore, in contrast to the doctors who are never present, the workers’ presence is the only social relation – apart from the solidarity or envy that other patients express – that is offered to the patient and that keeps them in communication with the outside world and with their own class reality. These social relations are not less important for the recovery of the patients than the medical treatment that they receive.</p>\n<p>It goes without saying that without the ‘precious collaboration’ of the workers, no specialist scientific activity could ever take place. Despite this, their activity is defined as auxiliary and the focus of attention lies on intellectual and specialised labour. From this results that they don’t hold any power; the ample space that is granted for union representation does not respond to a recognition of the role of labour, but to the need of capital to control it and to keep the masses of workers at a ‘corporative’ level. On this level one is only concerned with problems regarding the sale of ‘labour power’, rather than demanding to be valued as an essential social component for the production of a health service.</p>\n<p>From this emerges the tendency amongst those workers who rebel against this existing state of things to try and reconstruct how the hospital functions, in order to understand to which extent and how society depends on their labour. Many of their work colleagues respond to this with a mixture of incredulity and mistrust, given the fact that they are used to not demanding anything, as they are not valued themselves. The vanguard of the workers, in contrast, look around and ask themselves who benefits from the work that is performed in a hospital – and who performs that work. They discover that even amongst them there are people who perform tasks to cure the sick and others whose work only serves the medical barons; that there are useful activities and departments that should be expanded and others that are useless and are only there to make ‘the university’ look good; that also amongst those workers who are not manual workers not everyone is a parasite or there to control other workers (it is clear that a health service is not only produced by manual workers). As these experiences and valuations unify and confront each other, workers manage to grasp the laws of movement of the entire baronal system and to evaluate the weight of their own contribution in concrete terms and without mystifications (the understanding that they perform essential labour without which the barons would be nothing provides workers with a consciousness regarding their own power, whereas realising that one’s own work just helps to control people or to serve the barons can give an important insight into the conditioning that we are subjected to by the system).</p>\n<p>b) Even if workers are the basis of production, they don’t enjoy its fruits – and they only receive the ‘necessary wage’ from the resources that the state spends on the health sector, while others share the rest amongst them. These others – the hospital directos, the directors of administrations, the university barons and super-bureaucrats of any type – are the only public actors who appear and they appear by sharing the bulk of resources and by arguing about the criteria that this process of sharing out should take, with their own controversies, with their litigations and bickering. Only these actors are taken into account in journalistic inquiries or television programs when it comes to elaborations of improbable reform projects. Hence the interest of the workers to measure the distance between themselves and the others, which also entails to investigate these conflicts in order to understand the entire pyramide of power, which is made up by solid alliances at the top (the financial and familial connections between the medical barons, the intertwined partaking in the profits of the private clinics, mutual support between private and public entities) the attempts of corruption and cooptation of the intermediate layers (for who they concede the crumbs of the banquet) and the plundering of the lowest layer.</p>\n<p>c) The workers are those who are closest to the proletarian patients. Like them they find themselves at the lowest level of the hospital hierarchy, they come from the same social environment, they know – also through their own experience – that a fair share of the problems of the sick have social causes, and they are the only ones who have an interest in making these social factors become more visible (in contrast to the doctors who neglect the incidents of social factors in illness, in order to have free reign to exercise their ability as specialists).</p>\n<p>Hence the tendency amongst the workers to encourage the patients to speak, to let them participate in their assemblies, to investigate together the reasons for illness and to put the patients in a position to fight with greater strength against the oppressive experiences of the hospital.</p>\n<p>5. The knowledge that has been gained by the workers in the course of this process has been further deepened with the struggle for the ‘proletarian management of the hospital’ and during the development of this struggle new problems have emerged and are emerging that they have to reflect upon.</p>\n<p>At this point the reader might object and we want to respond to this possible objection immediately. One could concede that “the workers’ struggle has been interesting, but for heaven’s sake, you cannot base a whole theory on it”. Or perhaps one could think that “certain things” only happen at the Policlinico in Rome, and that this situation is unique and not comparable with other hospitals.</p>\n<p>We think that there are real aspects within the arguments that are made in favour of the ‘uniqueness’ of the situation at the Policlinico, but if anything these aspects make the situation at the Policlinico more ‘typical’ for the current health system in our country. There is, for example, the argument that because we deal with a ‘university clinic’ it doesn’t make sense to denounce the level of care that you are given there (this is an argumentation that implicitly admits that you have to pay a price for the sake of development, without saying explicitly who is supposed to pay it).</p>\n<p>On the contrary, we maintain that the Policlinico being a university clinic allows us to observe the ‘driving’ tendencies within modern medicine there, whose knowledge is increasingly appropriated by monopolistic capital which, in that way, positions itself against manual labour and the ‘ignorance’ of the masses. There we can observe, better than anywhere else, that the function of ‘research’ is reserved for specialists.</p>\n<p>Others, in turn, proclaim that the success of the workers’ struggle at the Policlinico depended on the particular nature of those in power there (who are easily identifiable as enemies of the masses) and on the little space that this form of power leaves for reformist politics: the merit of the workers is thereby reduced to having benefited from this favourable situation.</p>\n<p>It is true that the power of the medical barons is very consistent and concentrated. In Rome, the relations between economic, political and academic power – which are close everywhere – are directly linked to the decisions of the national government and therefore involve much more complex interests than in any other regional or provincial hospital. But even if this is true and if it makes the maneuvers of those in power more visible and easier to attack than in other places, it only means that here we can see ‘amplified’ what also happens elsewhere: even if there is less power to share in other places, the nature of those in power will neither be different, nor will their willingness to share power with others be greater. It is true that this intertwinement of power of the medical barons is highlighted in the health system in Rome, where a large layer of private hospitals coexists with the public health sector (with the barons as hinges at the top). But this condition exists in all regions of the country, even if not to the same proportions. [11]</p>\n<p>As we can see, all these are not particular characteristics which would impede to confront them with the situation in other hospitals or which would invalidate the significance of the workers’ struggle at the Policlinico, but rather they are concrete aspects of the development of the mode of production of health services in post-war Italy. [12]</p>\n<p>In our opinion the argumentation has to be put on its feet. One cannot understand this struggle if one doesn’t refer to the current general political situation in this country. The struggle at the Policlinico is integral part of the movement that developed in Italy in 1968: the students against the academic powers, the workers against various aspects of the capitalist mode of production, the popular masses against the mafia-clientelist regime of the christ-democrat government and against US imperialism. All these aspects are also verifiable within the struggle against the barons of the university, who centralise all these forms of power that are being criticized by the mass movement. It is not by chance that hospitals are one of the strongholds of the regime that has prospered with the Christ-Democrat government; due to the increased need for health care of the population, hospitals have grown excessively and have contributed to the social politics of the monopoly bourgeoisie: they have become centres for the formation of a clientele for high-ranking Christ-Democrats, they have played a role in controlling the labour market through recruitment policies, they have contributed to the formation of an intermediate social layer that is entrusted with a role of social stabilisation.</p>\n<p>These are elements that the new ‘democratic leadership’ of the region and the hospitals inherits and that it uses to affirm its new power. And although we are not able to tell why movements of this type didn’t also develop in other situations, or rather, why they only start to develop now, (we would need concrete and detailed analysis for that), it is clear that the only particular factor in this struggle was the capacity of those comrades who have led the struggle to use the contradictions of the situation as a lever (contradictions that we also see in other hospitals), with the aim to impact on those subjective elements that could emerge in this phase: the decline of the power of the barons, the real strength of the masses once they manage to overcome the divisions and fear. We can say that, despite many difficulties, in this case the proletarian leadership never failed. In the first place, workers were always clear about the fact that by attacking the parasitism of the barons you don’t remove cancer from an otherwise ‘healthy’ ‘public’ health system, but you rather attack a crucial aspect of the entire system in order to fight it better in future. In the second place, by withdrawing power from the barons workers were in a position to impede that their own problems were solved in a corporative fashion, that the divisions between patients and workers deepened, that the general interest in health provisions were sacrificed for particular interests (such as, for example, for efficiency, which is so dear to certain careerist doctors).</p>\n<p>6. The method that the workers used to advance on these levels was that of collective confrontation and of making decisions in assemblies. The assembly of workers in the Policlinico were never moments of ‘irrationality of the masses’ (the most basic level of consciousness), but rather a crucial moment in which the particular synthesises itself within the general: when everyone confronts themselves with everyone the truth about the social relations emerges and it becomes a strength in the moments when the worker faces the doctor or the head nurse alone to oppose their demand for complicity. In the daily assemblies that were organised during the course of struggle, starting from the knowledge about the most basic facts, a collective vision and a political will emerged that took into account the contributions of all workers and at the same time raised the level of political consciousness. [13]</p>\n<p>In this way, given the nature of the process that we were analysing, it seemed necessary to use these moments of collective elaboration as the main sources of our inquiry.</p>\n<p>As the reader will immediately notice, we used primarily the leaflets, because these reflect the tendency of creating a collective knowledge [tendenza conoscitiva) that we just mentioned. These leaflets were circulated frequently, initially every week and later on, from November 1973, they were produced daily. In this way the leaflets of the ‘Collective of workers’ are a true newspaper, with a capillary distribution in all departments of the hospital, a running commentary on the daily events that, at any occasion, put the workers’ reasoning in front of everyone who believed the in appearances rather than in seeking to analyse reality. They were not an agitatorial instrument of the ‘leading comrades’: their efficiency depended also on the way that they were produced, at the end of an assembly or a meeting, by various comrades who took turns, in a simple and comprehensible language (of the masses and by the masses).</p>\n<p>Apart from studying the leaflets, documents and discussion papers we also gathered much material by going to inquiry meetings with the workers and the patients in the hospital and its departments. These were meetings shaped by the necessity to clarify in detail what the changes were that the struggle produced, be it in the balance of power, the balance of power between workers and barons or in the relation between workers and patients. We spoke to workers who were involved in the struggle, but also to those who opposed it; we spoke with patients who understood the need for change, but also to those who “here everyone is a good person, one can see that the professor and consultant are like they ought to be”; with doctors who wanted to “to find a way to do something together with the workers”, but also with other medical professionals who thought that the workers were crazy.</p>\n<p>The structure of the book follows both a chronological and argumentative order: at the moment when a struggle broke out, we concentrated on the specific argument or issue of the struggle. At the same time the order of the arguments or issues is not incidental or arbitrary, but is determined by the process of the formation of workers’ consciousness and the way in which they have grasped the functioning of the hospital and the system of power that dominates them. This is a process that is still open and that requires further insights.</p>\n<p>The first three chapters describe how the political force of the workers developed around the struggle against the barons and the university hospital, for the unity and equality between workers and the transfer of the management from university to the regional health administration.</p>\n<p>The fourth chapter retraces the “five months of exemplary struggle” during which the masses emerged as protagonists of the “proletarian management of the hospital”, resulting in the conquest of the ‘regionalisation’.</p>\n<p>The fifth chapter focuses on the new contradictions which appeared between workers and revisionists and the different way in which power relations are being established in the hospital after the regionalisation.</p>\n<p>7. There is a final thing to say about our relationship with the workers of the Policlinico. With the work we were doing we did not aim to provide ‘an external service’ for the good comrades who were involved in the struggle, neither did we get involved in it ‘because it was a thing of our group or our party’. [14] We were facing a concrete reality which had the merit to bring to the surface those issues that we have just mentioned: issues that reflect the contradictions that are experienced by workers, all precisely analysed by the workers themselves, many of them confronted, even if they were not all resolved or not always resolved ‘in the best way possible’. We have tried to be part of the internal logic of the popular masses’ movement in order to show, also beyond the horizon of the hospital that this struggle refers to, which difficulties and which challenges they were facing once they decided to advance on the path of their own autonomy and not to entrust their own destiny neither to that part of the big monopolistic bourgeoisie and state that are in power today, nor to the other part that tries to grab power with the help of the popular masses and the wave of their struggle.</p>\n<p>For us this work serves to understand how the politics of our movement develops in reality, how it overcomes many obstacles in its way and which are its strong and weak points. It is for all comrades who feel part of this movement, independently from the organisations that they find themselves attached to at this moment, that we want to offer this contribution for reflection.</p>\n<p><strong>Footnotes</strong></p>\n<p>[1] Marx: Introduction to the Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right (1843) – Furthermore Marx says that the working class is “a class with radical chains” which “has a universal character by its universal suffering and claims no <em>particular right</em> because no <em>particular wrong</em>, but <em>wrong generally</em>, is perpetuated against it”. From here we can draw the necessary conclusion that the working class cannot liberate itself without liberating the entire humanity.</p>\n<p>[2] Footnote by translator: In terms of understanding, the comrades use the word ‘barons’ to describe the very elitist, if not semi-feudal character of the medical and university hierarchy at the time. Many of the bosses of the university clinics were embroiled in corruption and had close links with conservative, religious and sometimes fascist circles.</p>\n<p>[3] Another preconceived position, which is equally to be combatted even if it is actually less widely spread than the ones that we have mentioned above, is the position of very ‘streetwise’ comrades, who also oppose revisionism and who think that their group or party has the correct line already pocketed – and who participate in the struggle only in order to verify points of convergence and divergence with their line. They don’t bother to subject the experience of struggle to an analysis which would allow them to come to correct political conclusions, which might force them to change their own ideas eventually.</p>\n<p>[4] It seems though that this is the way in which Maoist teachings are received within our movement (even though they are then not applied). ‘To engage in inquiry’ has become synonymous with ‘not taking decision-making lightly, weighing up the various aspects of a question’ – a very sacrosanct position which gradually transformed itself into ‘being serious, reasonable, fighting movementism and spontaneity’, thereby forgetting that Mao said: “A Communist Party’s correct and unswerving tactics of struggle can in no circumstance be created by a few people sitting in an office; they emerge in the course of mass struggle, that is, through actual experience.” (Mao Tse-Tung, ‘Oppose Book Worship’</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-6/mswv6_11.htm\">OPPOSE BOOK WORSHIP (marxists.org)</a></p>\n<p>[5] In the presentation ‘Inquiry in the Xing’guo district’, Mao always invoked the necessity to carry out inquiry in the moment of struggle, against the particular deviations of both the right-wing and the ‘left-wing’ of the Communist Party of China.</p>\n<p>[6] If we are not taking into account the ‘conditioning’ and its transformations, we will end up endorsing revisionist politics, which only considers the existing conditions in order to maintain them, like a ‘more realistic’ form of politics than ours. This, though, is not more ‘realistic’, but conservative, in the sense that this type of politics tries to adapt itself, whereas only that practice is revolutionary which, starting from the given conditions, tries to overthrow them. (E. Masi, ‘Panzieri e il movimento revoluzionario’, in ‘Aut-aut’ no. 149-50, p.161)</p>\n<p>[7] In an article in ‘Rivolta di classe’ from October 1974, which describes the relations between workers and revisionists after the victory that had been obtained with the ‘regionalisation’ of the hospital service, it says: “The true response to these provocations [the spreading of lies and slander by the ‘workers’ party’] is the consciousness and autonomous organisation that workers have been strengthening, and the only relation that they by now have with the trade unions is the constant demonstration of their own power”. This assessment, which is rather triumphalistic, does not take due account of the fact that in this phase the trade union, after having lost a battle, reorganises itself in a different way in order to reconquer its power, precisely by basing its initiative on certain workers, those who are more privileged and less conscious, who constitute the social base of the union.</p>\n<p>[8] Most of the anti-institutional literature deals with the contradiction between the power of the institutions and the patients – and this is their merit – while, by doing so, it takes the “complicity” of the workers in the “consensus making” process of the institutions as a given. The same ‘class analysis of the hospital’, which this literature often refers to, tends to become a definition of the class origin of its subjects (doctors = middle to upper bourgeoisie / patients = proletarians etc.) without looking at the conditions from which ‘class struggle in the hospital’ develops. In this way, a book like ‘I diritti del malato’ (The rights of the sick), by G.Bert and others (Feltrinelli, 1975), while providing an extremely clear examination of the class nature of the experience of a patient in a public hospital, it never addresses the proletarian patient as someone who has behind them the power of a class and who can count on the alliance with hospital workers. Therefore, when it comes to the nurses, the book emphasises primarily the tendency of nurses making use of patients’ complaints in their “(ever present) internal rivalries”. In this way the struggle of the patients loses its precise class connotation and ends up locating itself on a purely legalistic plane of a “charter for patient rights” which the institutions are supposed to approve.</p>\n<p>[9] Amongst the many things that could be read in recent publications of democratic medicine, it seems that only Jervis provides a coherent analysis of the crucial significance of this factor, without which even the most innovative intervention risks ending up arming revisionism and the monopolistic sector of capital which it sustains. In the introduction of his ‘Manuale critico di psichiatria’ (‘Critical manual of psychiatry’) (Feltrinelli, 1975) Jervis states that in the struggle for health “the role of the working class, be it inside or outside of the factories, is the role of leadership: both because of their own living and health conditions and their organised force and political preparedness”. (p.39) But between words and deeds… we think that only if statements like this find actual application in the struggle of democratic medicine (with the consequence of deepening the struggle also against the trade union leadership of the medical professions) would it be possible to talk about a true alliance between proletariat and democratic medical professionals. Without workers’ leadership – on the contrary – the masses remain the base of yea-sayers [base di consenso] for a sector of progressive intellectuals.</p>\n<p>[10] T.W. Adorno, Scritti Sociologici, Torino, Einaudi, 1976, p.346</p>\n<p>[11] In this sense there never exists a particular situation in which the general model would not be retraceable. It is only the particular conditions, together with the dialectical capacity of the masses to impact upon them, which allow us to verify an interpretative model. The Policlinico is not a ‘backward’, ‘distorted’ or ‘abnormal’ hospital, nor is the economic development in Italy compared to other capitalist countries.</p>\n<p>[12] G.Berlinguer and S.Scarpa (in ‘La riforma sanitaria’, Editori riuniti, 1974) provide the following figures: in Lazio, 32.91% of all hospital beds are in private hospitals, while, in order to make significant examples, in Lombardia the figure is 15.96%, in Emilia 14.64%, in Basilicata</p>\n<p>42.10%. The national average is 17.22%, the average in the central north is 15.13%, in the south and Isole it’s 23.20%. Rome, therefore, which largely informs the figures for Lazio, has a high percentage of private hospitals, but it shares this condition with most cities in the south, while the phenomena isn’t absent also in the big cities in the north.</p>\n<p>[13] It is political practice, by increasing the level of consciousness of the workers, that also expands their capacity for inquiry. It is not the inquiry itself which raises their consciousness. The assumption by Panzieri that “the method of inquiry has to secure a scientific observation of the ‘level of consciousness’ that the working class has obtained and has therefore also to be the way to ‘lift this consciousness to a higher level’”, seems to require an evaluation from two separate visual angles. It is true, on one hand, that it contains an anti-dogmatic element, which Masi interprets in this way: “The working class are the workers, the new protagonists of history. But only to the degree to which they are aware of it and know how to do it”. But, on the other hand, it also seems to overestimate the political impact that inquiry, organised by groups of comrades, can actually have on the objective conditions of inquiry. But let’s remember that these notes were written in 1964, a bad year for proletarian autonomy, in which vanguard groups like ‘Quaderni Rossi’ were inclined to operate on levels that went beyond what was actually possible.</p>\n<p>[14] The main militants of the ‘Collective of workers at the Policlinico’ have always been from the workers’ autonomy in Rome, while those who write this text work within the Centro Stampa Comunista di Roma.</p>\n"},"posts":{"edges":[{"node":{"title":"Nicoletta Stame and Francesco Pisarri: Proletarians and health (1977) – Chapter One","excerpt":"<p>A book about the autonomous workers&#8217; committee at the university clinic in Rome in the 1970s, bringing together medical students and porters, workers and patients.</p>\n","slug":"nicoletta-stame-and-francesco-pisarri-proletarians-and-health-1977-chapter-one","date":"2024-05-09T15:36:33","featuredImage":{"node":{"sourceUrl":"https://vitalsignscontenteditor.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/20240122_140841-1536x1536-1.jpg","altText":""}},"author":{"node":{"name":"Angry Workers","firstName":"Angry","lastName":"Workers","avatar":null}},"pdf":{"pdf":null},"categories":{"edges":[{"node":{"name":"History"}}]},"tags":{"edges":[]},"content":"<p><em>You can read a short summary about the struggles described in the book </em><a href=\"https://www.angryworkers.org/2023/08/31/struggles-in-the-1970s-at-the-polyclinic-in-rome-part-1%ef%bf%bc/\"><em>here</em></a><em> and watch a documentary </em><a href=\"https://en.labournet.tv/policlinico-assembly-workers\"><em>here</em></a><em>.

Secondly, despite the fact that the times and conditions have changed, we can still learn a lot from these experiences. </em></p>\n<p><strong>What is the teaching hospital?</strong></p>\n<p>The Policlinico Umberto I was founded at the beginning of the 20th century as a nursing hospital for the poor, managed by the Pius Institute together with the St. Spirito hospital. In the following decades, the hospital developed more according to the requirements of the medical faculty to which it is attached [1] than according to the needs of its potential patients.</p>\n<p>In 1971, when the independent workers’ struggle began, the Policlinico comprised seven departments – the so-called ‘pavilions’ – with a total 763 beds, administered by the regional health board, and 42 clinics with 3,285 beds, which were dependent on the university (and therefore on the Ministry for Education).</p>\n<p>Considering that in the public sector in Rome there are only 13,739 hospital beds, it becomes clear that the Policlinico represents one of the major centres in the health system of the city, which in its entirety is largely insufficient for a population of about 3 million inhabitants (without taking into account that a continuous stream of patients from the south of Italy is burdening the hospitals in Rome, where there is even a greater lack of hospitals).</p>\n<p>But it is also necessary to know that while the pavilions are organised like a ‘normal’ hospital and at least aim at providing medical care, the clinics, on the other hand, given that they constitute the ‘teaching hospital’, provide care only in a way that is subordinated to their institutional purpose, which is the professional education of medical personnel (in order to show a student how you treat a patient, the patient is also treated). Therefore the clinics are subjected to a particular regime that makes them barely suited to the purpose of providing care.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the faculty of medicine is not satisfied with the situation, and intends to expand further, proposing repeatedly to turn the entire Policlinico into an Institute for higher research [2].  would be a severe misfortune for the popular masses of the capital and for the workers of the hospital. We will see why.</p>\n<p>The characteristics of the ‘teaching hospital’ can be summarised in the following way.</p>\n<p>The first characteristic is the selection of patients. As far as possible, the clinics don’t treat the popular masses in the surrounding neighbourhoods based on their needs. Patients, including those coming from other regions, are chosen based on their illness (taking into account also the background of their social class). This selection happens according to a precise order of priorities: first of all those patients are chosen who have an illness which is of interest for current research purposes, both in terms of pure and applied research, which means that patients become guinea pigs for pharmaceutical experiments. This is followed by those patients who have an ‘interesting’ illness in terms of being showcases for the students or specialists. The third category of patients are those who have common illnesses, who are therefore of interest for the specialists to ‘practice on’.</p>\n<p>While the first two categories of patients (for research and teaching purposes) are chosen from amongst the proletarian patients who come to the general hospital admission desk (the so-called ‘warehouse’), or the admission desk of the clinics, the third category of patients (which is the only one that is merely ‘treated’) has a different provenance. These are the ‘patients of the director’ who have already been filtered through private surgeries for diagnosis, but who, for example, cannot afford the actual treatment in the private clinic of the director, or who have a recommendation from one of the medical barons to undergo – more or less free of charge – expensive examinations which the private clinics are not able to perform. This means that even those patients who are in the hospital just to be ‘cured’ – and there are some, which demonstrates that the Policlinico would be able to provide actual treatment if that was wanted – are not patients who just happen to be there. Patients who have just turned up randomly at the admission desks, and who are not ‘chosen’ by any of the clinics, are discharged after a few days. In the meantime, they have perhaps caught another hospital-related infection from the neighbouring beds, given that all patients are piled up on each other without distinction. They are transferred to other hospitals in the city which, given that they are not ‘teaching’ hospitals, cannot refuse them.</p>\n<p>The second characteristic is the lack of nursing staff. In contrast to the large numbers of doctors, due to the ‘teaching needs’ of the numerous students [3], there is a scarcity of paramedical staff such as porters, nurses and technicians. There are around 2,700 of them, officially employed for learning and research purposes, but also employed as care workers, while from a nursing perspective a workforce of 4,500 would be necessary,because these 2,700 don’t all engage in proper nursing work, given the fact that in the clinics they are preferentially used as messengers or typists and therefore only engage in care work on paper. And the doctors certainly would not debase themselves to perform the work of porters, which results in a very reduced scope to perform care work – even when the potential (and availability) of staff working overtime is taken into account. Therefore the teaching hospital ends up with a good number of empty beds. Between 1964 and 1974 on average only 75% [4] of all beds were used, in contrast to the ‘pavilions’ where the patients are piled up even in the corridors and bathrooms.</p>\n<p>The third characteristic is the irregular nature of the work relation of the nursing workers. The irregularity starts with the clientelist hiring process, which is – to say the truth – not much different from those in other hospitals. There is not a single worker in the Policlinico who wouldn’t admit they got hired because ‘they already knew someone’ – and because, in many cases, they have been recommended to the university baron, the head of the personnel department or the head sister by the priest of the parish of their village, by the secretary of the local section of the DC (Democratic Party) or another government party or, finally, by the trade union. Such an entry to the workforce then defines the behaviour that is expected by this ‘clientele’: becoming members of the recommending political party or trade union or performing, as part of their work, all kinds of informal personal services or other activities for their ‘guardians’, in particular services which have nothing to do with nursing. It’s enough to think about election campaigns, when the nuns and boot-lickers of all kinds become active to ‘defend the free world’ by banking the entire votes of the hospital workers and their families, of the patients and their relatives for the bosses of the DC, or other government parties (the Policlinico has always been a solid fiefdom of the DC).</p>\n<p>If we keep these premises in mind, it is easy to understand how the behaviour of those who have succeeded in getting hired by the Policlinico is constricted, and in which ways their labour is from then on actually regulated. As the workers of the clinics are employed by the Ministry of Public Education for the requirements of teaching and research, and given the fact that their work contract is that of a public servant, it is not presumed that they perform other types of labour, as these would not be officially recognised. However, these workers perform actual nursing labour, with specific job tasks, shift patterns and regulations that are absolutely different from those of any other ‘ministerial worker’. For example, the official working day of employees of the Ministry is six hours long, from 8am to 2pm, while the workers in the clinics work shifts (of eight hours, plus two hours overtime, on all days of the week, also on bank holidays). The Ministry employs them as ‘janitors’, while they work as porters, nurses and also perform other nursing tasks. The Ministry rules out night-shifts and hazardous work [5], while these workers do both.</p>\n<p>This situation is the source of great discrimination towards these workers, in addition to the difficulties it creates when it comes to caring for patients. You would not ask a janitor to know how to administer an injection, or take someone’s blood pressure, etc.. Now, while it happens on one hand that a worker who has been hired without particular skills (as a janitor you only need to have passed the fifth elementary school class) can learn how to do their work, to take the lead from the patients and to gradually take on tasks with greater responsibility; on the other hand, the irregularity of their work relation will never be cured. Management pretends to solve some of these issues by paying compensations [6], but many others are sources for a particular subordination of the workers regarding their two bosses – the Ministry and the director of the clinics.</p>\n<p>Let’s start with the question of the organisation of work within the clinic. As there is not a legal status with a job description that would assign particular tasks to workers with the respective competence and diploma (and how could you, if everyone is a ‘janitor’?); and because it is only prescribed that in the ‘research institutes’ the workers do ‘whatever is necessary for the requirements of research’ – meaning, the insidious requirements of the barons – the workers find themselves at the mercy of the will of the latter, who assign heavier or lighter work tasks as they please, dish out recognitions and punishments, grant overtime and career advancements as they see fit, and put one worker against the other in order to consolidate their power in the clinic. The barons use a whole array of loyal lieutenants for this management of the ‘administration’ of their clientele: nuns, head nurses, secretaries, foremen and forewomen who have been chosen by them, and only answer to them in order to make sure that everything runs according to their will.</p>\n<p>There is therefore an issue of the relationship between tasks and qualifications. The majority of workers who have been hired as janitors (a qualification corresponding to the qualification of a porter, who is only supposed to undertake cleaning and transport tasks) actually perform the work of technicians, nurses, head nurses etc. Yet their formal status, in terms of contract and pay, is that of a janitor.</p>\n<p>Often, in order to get around the ‘rigidity of the law’, workers who find themselves in such a situation pursue professional training courses in technical institutes, of their own accord.: In order to get a salary commensurate with the tasks performed in the hospital, these workers try to enforce a formal qualification (a ‘patentino’or license) which they obtained outside the hospital. There is a lot to say about the difference between what they learn ‘in theory’ in these institutes, and the hard practical reality of a profession which they already know very well!. Naturally, this adjustment of the wage also depends on the whim of the barons. Once the patentino has been obtained, in order to transfer to the higher job category (for example, that of a nurse), the worker needs a ‘’ from the director of the clinic, declaring that the work has been performed in a ‘commendable’ fashion. If the baron does not want to issue this note, the worker will not be promoted, even if they have the diploma. [7]</p>\n<p>Finally, there’s the question of the stablility of the work relationship. If a messenger employed by the Ministry accrues a certain amount of years seniority they can, if they pass a trial period, be promoted to a superior role. Can such a thing happen to a janitor who works as a nurse? As there is no official trace of the fact that they work as a nurse, that they have a diploma etc., the janitor in the clinic – in contrast to the messenger in the Ministry – can accrue endless stages of seniority without there being any planned career progression, for example from janitor to ‘health supervisor’. To circumvent these career ladder problems, management only issues annually-renewable contracts for janitors. In this way, the issue of accruing seniority is avoided. It means, in substance, that because they are not in one of the the  nursing job categories, they belong to no job category at all. And here we’re still dealing with ‘permanent’ work relations.. here are many cases of truly precarious work contracts: workers who are hired for 88 days (because this means that they cannot prove three months of continuous service, which would give them a legal entitlement to a permanent contract), who are then sent home and re-hired after a few months.</p>\n<p>There are even workers who are only hired for the day, the ‘giornalieri’ (day labourers), the true ‘hands of nursing’: these present themselves every morning to see if they can substitute for absent workers. They don’t have a fixed work contract and are paid for the day!! [8]</p>\n<p>These normative aspects, so to speak, of the clientelist organisation of the clinics have a profound impact too on the behaviour of those who experience the subordinate side of this reality on a daily level: the workers and patients.</p>\n<p>Given the precarious situation in which they find themselves, and the climate of ruthless competition with their colleagues, the main activity expected from a worker is to humour the barons in any way, hoping for some special compensation. In this way, the worker is alienated from their work, they don’t exercise any kind of control over it, and step by step they are dragged into becoming accomplices of antipopular medicine, into not giving a fuck about the patients, and into seeing them only as awkward objects on which to perform the tasks that the barons demand. They think that they don’t have any other interest apart from becoming a public servant and receiving a wage to get by.</p>\n<p>The patients, on the other hand, who have submitted to the image of the baron as the great luminary of science on which their cure depends, find themselves in daily contact with the workers and their attitude of ‘I don’t give a damn’. This pushes the patients into blaming the workers for their bad medical treatment, and to trying to win the benevolence of the barons by all means (with gifts and favours). If all this shows that in this type of hospital the nursing aspect is subordinated to the research purposes, what type of health care is then actually given? And what is its relationship to the care given in other hospital units?</p>\n<p>Too answer this question, it’s important to keep other factors in mind. In a social organisation that aims at the realisation of profits and accumulation, even the performance of medical services is oriented towards that goal.</p>\n<p>There is a private sector which says openly that its aim is to create a profit from the health needs of the middle-class, and which organises itself to be able to offer ever more adequate services, also using the infrastructure that the state specifically provides. For example, by sending their own patients to public hospitals when it is necessary to use very expensive technology for examinations which only the state can afford to purchase; or by applying new treatments or medication that have already been tried on proletarian patients in public hospitals.</p>\n<p>Then there is the public sector, which pretends to mediate social antagonisms by reducing class differences when it comes to sickness and health care (“the medicine which cures both rich and poor”) – whereas in reality, it offers a service for proletarians which does not aim at the reconstitution of their health, but rather at the reproduction of their labour power, so that capital is able to make use of it again.</p>\n<p>The bourgeois patient can afford to pay for better services offered by private clinics [9], and their relationship with the doctor – even if they are treated in a university clinic – is a contractual relation between equals. [10] “The bosses are treated in the private clinics and they are supposed to recover completely in order to be able to perform again, with their full faculties, in their role as exploiters. With the bosses you cannot mess things up”, says the Collective. By contrast proletarian patients, who are nursed because they are covered by health insurance, receive treatment according to their subordinate position in society. “In the Policlinico, proletarians are only patched up and sent back to their place of work and exploitation, and if they die during the process, which often happens, it is just a common mishap”, continues the Collective. [11]</p>\n<p>Often, the proletarian patient has personally experienced the dual reality of the private and public medical system, and can draw comparisons. A patient who was treated at the neurosurgical clinic directed by Guidetti said during an assembly: “As long as I had money I stayed at Villa Giulia, where Guidetti was very kind and thoughtful. Now that the money has run out and that I am here through the common health insurance, Guidetti ignores me completely, as if I wasn’t me anymore”.</p>\n<p>We can conclude,contrary to the common sense that claims care provision at the Policlinico is better because the doctors there are more ‘knowledgeable’ thhat proletarian patients misfortunate enough to arrive here receive the worst care possible within this ‘stopgap medicine’ practiced at the public hospitals for the mere purpose of reproducing labour power, and also being treated as guinea pigs  And within this classist organisation of medicine lies the reason for this ‘misfortune’ afflicting the socially most vulnerable people, who, apart from not being able to afford better care in the private clinics, are also not prepared to protect themselves against the abuses of medical trials, which they would not be subjected to in ‘normal’ hospitals.</p>\n<p><strong>Workers, students and the struggle for health</strong></p>\n<p>Reflecting the aspect of oppression experienced by workers and patients, in the moment of the great awakening that followed the student and workers’ struggles of 1968-69, a new consciousness emerged among some hospital workers, with a new watchword: defeat class medicine and the power of the barons, unite workers and patients in the struggle against the teaching hospital. The realisation of this programme will be a long and tortuous process before being taken up by the oppressed masses, for whom it represents the only possibility of liberation.</p>\n<p>Before the start of the struggle of nursing staff in the university clinics against the teaching hospital, the Policlinico already witnessed the agitation of the Collective of medical students which proposed two goals: “no to class medicine” and “doctors should be educated in those places where sickness originates”. These very general slogans managed to create a progressive sector among medical students, who are, by social background and aspiration, the most integrated in the classist dimension of education that they receive. But they had not yet facilitated an alliance between progressive students and all those – hospital workers and proletarian patients – who could, and need to be, united against the target of the hour: the university barons.</p>\n<p>The political limitations of both the students’ and workers’ actions can be seen as a root cause of this failed alliance. On one side there was a typical ‘workerist’ idealism amongst the students, which, in their search for the proletariat, didn’t see it in the porters or the patients on the hospital wards, and with whom there would have been lots of things to talk about. Instead they were chasing it amongst the factory workers of the metal manufacturing sector in Tiburtina, to whom they later on proposed discourses from the outside about science not being neutral, and about exploitation as a reason for physical harm, which, to be fair, remained abstract; because these discourses were not the product of an elaboration taking the experiences of these workers as a starting point.</p>\n<p>On the other side, the weakness of the workers’ actions were due to the corporatist politics of trade union organisations which only took care of the economic issues – and even that only just about – and which were organised in a way that discriminated against the workers in the clinics, and the little influence they had within the hospital.</p>\n<p>Firstly, workers who perform the same tasks and who work side by side in the same part of the hospital were members of two different trade unions, depending on the institutions that they belonged to. The workers of the pavilions were part of the Federation of Hospital Workers (Federazione lavoratori ospedalieri), whereas the workers of the clinics were members of SUNPU (Joint national union of university staff CGIL-CISL-UIL / Sindacato unitario nazionale personale universitario), an organisation of state employees. [12]</p>\n<p>The former, who were part of a collective contract, entered into dispute once the contract had to be renegotiated and perhaps went on strike a few times for the ‘health reform’. The latter mobilised themselves whenever the union agitated state employees, and perhaps in order to support ‘bureaucratic reform’.</p>\n<p>Sometimes SUNPU had to take care of these particular ‘state employees’ because they lacked the usual cover of job security (and therefore security of income). In these cases, SUNPU adapted itself to a role recognised by those in power when it comes to precarious labour, in particular when it is bordering unemployment: forming a clientele and pushing for an ad hoc intervention of the ministry. Occasionally the latter then concedes a small legal measure [13] in order to control the dissatisfaction of the workers, and to correct a situation which has become too irregular or, alternatively, the ministry puts vacancies out for irregular workers to compete for. In this way, while the union reinforces its role as an intermediary [14], the minister and his party gain votes in subsequent elections.</p>\n<p>So workers were never mobilised around the general issues at the core of their precarious employment, or concrete problems of their work. Their cases were dealt with on an individual basis, or at the most as cases of a few people spread across various clinics, between whom the unions acted as middle-men. Ministers who were out of reach were asked to provide solutions, and workers had no control whatsoever over the proceedings of negotiations concerning them.</p>\n<p>When, later on, the union wanted to take the complex situation of the workers in the clinics into consideration, they always did it in a way that emphasised the ‘difference’ between them and other nursing workers; meaning, their condition as state employees. For example they pushed for struggles that aimed at getting recognition for the special status of research work, or at equalisation with other state employees. [15] In this way, they end up aggravating the discrimination of the workers in the clinics, and reducing the possibility of creating a force of all hospital and university workers around the problems of nursing.</p>\n<p>In spring 1971 some clinic workers wanting to organise a struggle around their working conditions had extracted themselves from the clientelist politics of SUNPU. They started to meet up with a group of medical students. This group had formed during an ‘external’ intervention in the industrial area of Tiburtina with the environmental commission of the local council.</p>\n<p>The outcome of this experience in Tiburtina, which took place during the time the collective contract in metal manufacturing came up for renewal and which focussed on the problem of toxic working conditions in the factories, led to a division between the students. On one side there were those who saw the outcome as positive. They intended to continue working within the Collective of Medicine as it were (essentially an instrument for the political socialisation of students) [16] and could imagine the creation of stable links with the popular masses only through the support of the trade union left. [17] On the other side there were those who saw the political limits of the experience. They criticised the fact that the relation between the students and the exploited masses was based on the subordination to the trade union line, also because the students had no precise role in this action. According to their view, to engage in an external intervention of such a kind, however related to the discourse about the qualification of a doctor, is an escape – a symptom of the inability to struggle on one’s own terrain (which is, instead, the contradiction with the university barons). And this is even more mistaken in a moment where the workers of the clinics started to develop their struggle against the barons.</p>\n<p>In this way the second group of students (some of whom had found work as technicians or analysts at the clinics in the meantime, and would later on have a determining role in the leadership of the struggle) identified the possibility of unifying students and clinic workers in a common struggle against the barons, with the objective of a ‘proletarian management of the hospital’ appealing to all the social forces interested in the struggle for health – hospital workers, the popular masses who live in the surrounding neighbourhoods and who should have been ‘served’ by the hospital, the worker-patients and the progressive students. The Collective of Workers and Students at the Policlinico emerged on this basis.</p>\n<p>This different way to impose the struggle for health inside of the hospital (contrary to what was said later on by those who continue within the Collective of Medicine) does not mean abandoning the students as subjects of this struggle, but calling back onto the terrain where their action can be more specific, and therefore more autonomous. The clinic barons are also their professors at university.. In the course of the subsequent struggle against the ‘teaching hospital’, which is in itself an objective of progressive students (certainly not those who want to make an academic career!), there were multiple times when the Collective of Workers and Students at the Policlinico tried to involve the students in struggles dealing with concrete aspects of their subordination within the faculty and hospitals in which they ‘exercise’. For example, during one of the many times when the barons tried to turn the entire Policlinico into a teaching hospital, the Collective addressed the students with the following words, explaining to them that such an institutional change would oppress them more, and calling them to struggle together with the workers:</p>\n<p>“They try to keep students ever more distant from the hospitals where day-to-day medicine is practiced, in order to prevent them from understanding which role medical practice has today: enriching oneself on the backs of the patient by curing diseases without understanding their true causes, which are based on exploitation. This is the most fundamental fact that emerges from the workers’ and student struggle, which the students should take into account if they really want to operate within the framework of a true class struggle. While it is true that amongst the students there are ‘daddy’s sons’ who are not interested in combating the strategy of the barons in white coats, there are also proletarian students who know what the exploitation is that they suffer day in and day out, and who oppose and mobilise themselves against the bosses and their lackeys. Until now all the objectives that students have put forward (research collectives, alternative educational programs etc.) have not been obtained, as they evidently don’t hit the bosses’ organisation in its vital parts. Today, instead, we want exactly that: to destroy the barons’ strategy and their sources of wealth at their foundation. Comrades, it is necessary to join the struggle of the workers at the university clinics […] Currently we organise ourselves to beat the anti-worker structures of the faculty which uphold the mystification of the tasks of medicine during lectures and later on during the exams”. (12th of February 1973)</p>\n<p>However, the major novelty, when it comes to the way the Collective of Workers and Students at the Policlinico engaged with the struggle for health, concerned other aspects.</p>\n<p>Firstly, the Collective emphasised the need to define the proletarian struggle for health in a different way, having developed a critique of the subordination in which the students found themselves regarding the trade union line. “To fight for the defence of health means to confront day in and day out the mechanisms and structure through which the bosses manage the exploitation of workers: the home, the school, the transport system, the health system should increasingly become terrain of conflict beyond the factory; it is those struggles that break the isolation of workers, which gather workers of all sectors for a common class struggle”. [18] If instead, one remains within the confines of the factory and doesn’t struggle for the defense of the physical integrity of the proletariat in all moments of social life, it becomes more likely that the struggle against toxic working conditions becomes ‘monetarised’, meaning, that the workers’ health is considered like a thing (a commodity) that has simply to be sold at a higher price and that one gets imprisoned within a normal ‘trade union dispute’. [19]</p>\n<p>Here we come across a second issue. The popular masses, who express a need for health at the moment when they come into contact with the institutions that are supposed to satisfy their needs, invariably face a series of concrete problems: there are no hospitals or they are located far away; often you have to pay bribes to enter; [20]  health insurance doesn’t cover certain services; the university clinics give a different treatment depending on economic considerations and they use proletarian patients as guinea pigs etc.</p>\n<p>But within these oppressive structures a more favourable situation can open up for the proletarian patient once a contradiction develops between the nursing workers and the group of ‘political-scientific’ leaders (in the case of the Policlinico, the barons of the university clinics), meaning that once the workers develop a consciousness that the subordination they suffer depends on the fact that, although they produce a service that is necessary for the masses, they work for the dominant classes, who at the same time oppress the popular masses and enrich themselves through their labour.</p>\n<p>While in other institutions which have purely repressive or controlling purposes towards the masses, such as the state bureaucracy, the police force etc., workers are separated both from power and from the masses they oppress, in the hospital, on the contrary (like in other ‘social’ services that the state has gradually incorporated) the presence of the masses themselves tends to burst open the internal class contradiction, and workers’ struggle cannot then disregard it. [21]</p>\n<p>Based on this general assessment of the condition of proletarians regarding the issue of health, workers who joined the Collective and linked up to the external struggles refused their privileged position as ‘state employees’ or as ‘guard dogs’ of power who are placed above the masses right from the start. They struggled against all divisions between workers (and against all corporatist actions that maintained them) in order to blow up the repressive function of the hospital and to create a unity between workers and patients. [22] Therefore: “No to the teaching and research hospital; yes, instead, to a hospital that provides care and that unites the hospital and university workers” (10th of November 1972).</p>\n<p>This position is the foundation stone for the slogans of the day: “Proletarian management of health”, “No to the exploitation of workers and patients” [23] and of the objective for the transfer of all workers in the clinics to the administrative entity of the hospital, which characterised the Collective right since its emergence.</p>\n<p>In this longer quote from one of the Collective’s first leaflets, it becomes clear how they explain to the masses their decision to constitute themselves as an independent organisation:</p>\n<p>“The function of the state in our country is to be a repressive apparatus in the hands of the bosses, in order to keep the workers in a relation of exploitation.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>State employees understand that within the differences amongst themselves, they work in entirely different sectors.</li>\n<li>Employees of the ministries, for example, live within the bureaucracy and are as such neither directly situated within the productive apparatus, which is the factory, nor within social services, which is the school and the health sector, and therefore they don’t live in direct contact with the general problems of the working class.</li>\n<li>In contrast to this, the non-teaching staff of the university and the university clinics work within social services such as the school and the hospital.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These workers therefore feel the very contradictions of these structures directly, the problems that stem from the bosses’ power in the school and most of all in the health sector, and the profound insufficiencies that afflict these social sectors. From all this emerges the necessity for profound and radical changes.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Through their work they are in daily contact with workers who fall sick, because the subordination to exploitation continues not only at the assembly lines, but also in the poor ghettoised neighbourhoods, in the city where you no longer move around and up. From these relationships emerges a new consciousness which pushes the clinic workers to join up with all other workers in order to destroy this violence.</li>\n<li>Finally, all university workers are in contact with the students, which in recent years have expressed, through their struggle at the side of the workers, the will to combat the exploitation by bosses and barons in schools and the entire society.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The struggles the university workers have conducted so far show that they lagged behind struggles of other workers, for example the hospital workers, who were initially perceived as having a status inferior to the university workers. They enforced such levels of economic improvements that their treatment is now superior to that of their university colleagues,and they are even considered as having drawn ‘the golden ticket’.</p>\n<p>“All this has happened not because there are ‘better’ workers and ‘worse’ workers, but because the potential of the university workers to struggle has been limited by the fact that they are intimately linked to the staff of the ministry and all the other state employees in general, including the medium and upper level of the bureaucrats. The struggles and strikes […] were therefore not able to disengage from a logic that was wholly internal to the system. Despite themselves, the university workers were then forced to reduce the qualitative scope of their demands and to lead cooperative struggles, for example, for the maintenance of privileged status, including private payments for hospital rooms or for outpatient services etc.” (18th of May 1971)</p>\n<p>From this moment on the collective took their own action forward, clarifying their position wherever the occasion emerged, emphasising the objectives of the struggle within which the masses could be organised, explaining better the objective to abolish the teaching hospital.</p>\n<p>It was a struggle that developed in alternating phases, which in some moments saw the collective limiting itself to contrasting the actions of the trade union with a different discourse, and in other moments saw autonomous initiatives – also on an organisational level. Initially the Collective was composed of a minority of workers from the clinics. Bit by bit the collective’s discourse imposed itself, and the SUNPU first became a minority and then disappeared. The discourse started in 1971 and had a first significant success in spring 1974, which delivered a heavy blow to the subordination of workers and the power of the barons: the transfer of the clinic workers to the general hospital staff. From this moment a new phase, and new pitfalls, opened up in which the challenge of leading the struggle against the monopolistic power of the state and capital in the health sector intertwined with the challenge to counteract the advance of revisionism, which appeared under the new disguise of the ‘democratic management of the hospital’. In the following chapters we will reconstruct the phases of this process.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Footnotes</strong></p>\n<p>[1] For the period from May 1971 to the beginning of December 1973, the quotations of the leaflets of the Collective of Workers and Students at the Policlinico are signed with the simple mentioning of the date. We indicate explicitly those cases where the leaflets have a different signature. The requirements of the medical faculty increased with the rising numbers of students (600 enrolments in 1964, 4,000 in 1974) and professors (from 40 to 120 during the same period).</p>\n<p>[2] The faculty demands the application of law no. 1140 from the 26th of October 1964, whose enactment has so far been postponed, which stipulates “regulations for the separation of the Policlinico Umberto I in Rome from the administration of the Pius Institute of the Holy Spirit and the assignment of the entire complex to the University of Rome”, “for the requirements of expansion and modernisation of the clinics and the institutes of the Faculty of Medicine and Chirurgy” (article 1). The law stipulates the construction of a hospital with 1,000 beds and a boarding school for 280 students (article 2). Within two years from the time of granting the loan for the new hospital, the process of transferring the ‘pavilions’ to the university is supposed to start and to be concluded within four years. (article 6)</p>\n<p>[3] In the Policlinico there is on average one doctor for every 4 patients, or 1 for 2 if we also consider specialised doctors. In other hospitals, in comparison, the ratio is 1 doctor for 7 patients. However, these averages don’t make sense if they are not seen within a particular context. There are some clinics where there are more doctors than patients (which is not surprising, if you want to study a very rare medical case!), while it can be that in the general admission /accident and emergency department you might find only 1 doctor for 30 patients!</p>\n<p>[4] Quoted from: S. Guerra, R. Masini, L. Isolabella, E. Santoro, ‘Ipotesi di riassetto sanitario della città di Roma’, Casilina, Roma 1974, p.59. In a survey at the Policlinico from 1974-75 the number of patients was 3,180: in the meantime this number might have come down by another 100?</p>\n<p>[5] This ranges from hazards that stem from the type of work, for example the work of radiology workers, who engaged in a struggle around this issue in the winter of 1973, to those that are due to the conditions of overexploitation in which the subcontracted workers are kept. These conditions are often found amongst cleaners, maintenance and kitchen workers etc. The question of radiology is also clearly explained to the patients themselves: “The workers make clear that they are no longer willing to suffer the exploitation of a type of work that is in itself harmful, not only for themselves, but also for the patients, who often suffer the incompetence of those who put their hands under the x-rays, while the radiographer presses a button from a distance […] There are many cases where the detected exposure to radiation is too high.” This is followed by an example of a radiation certificate of an imaging porter (leaflet 10th of March 1973, signed by ‘Workers of the Radiology’).</p>\n<p>[6] The bonus payments for night-shifts and hazardous work tasks are paid out of a special fund of the university.</p>\n<p>[7] The law 1125 from the 3rd of November 1961 even stated that “in order to be employed within the job category III of a nurse, the possession of a diploma is not required […] provided that the performed labour is recognised as commendable”.</p>\n<p>[8] These workers often wait for several hours, till the end of a shift, in order to be given work. For them, of course, there are no paid bank holidays, sick pay and so on. It is enough to be sick for a day and unable to come to the HR office in order to lose even this fragile connection with the hospital. At the end of the month they are paid for the days that they have worked.</p>\n<p>[9] And the higher their profit margins, the more they try not only to cure, but also to offer a hotel-like comfort, which is a question of prestige pure and simple. You can take the disproportionate importance of obstetrics departments in the private clinics as an example, in particular in the South. To give birth in luxury is in fact one of the most important status symbols of the southern bourgeoisie, who, as everyone knows, attribute a lot of importance to motherhood.</p>\n<p>[10] This doesn’t mean that, also in the relation with the bourgeois patient, the doctor would not use their own knowledge in an exclusive manner, but they use it at their service, like the bourgeois who would supply the doctor with their own goods or a different kind of service. The bourgeoisie, in their mutual relationship, understand the class motives in their reciprocal ‘exclusivity’ and don’t feel regret about it. A lawyer or an engineer would not like to share their own knowledge with a doctor when representing him in a court case, or build him a house, in the same way that the doctor does not impart his own knowledge when they fall ill.</p>\n<p>[11] From a leaflet of the Assembly of the Workers at the Policlinico, from the 24th of June 1974.</p>\n<p>[12] Being part of SUNPU was seen as a factual membership of CGIL, even though on paper one was a member of the three union federations. The unions of non-teaching university staff divided up their zones of influence: while the CGIL was only present in the clinics, CISL and UIL represented staff in the actual university. (5th of June 1972)</p>\n<p>[13] For example the law no. 1225 of the 3rd of November 1961 prescribes the job transfer of those precarious workers who have been hired after the 1st of June 1961; the law of the 28th of February 1970 prescribes the job transfer of those hired after the 31st of July 1970. As these laws give these workers a supernumerary status, who wait for posts to become free, they are only a halfway solution, because initially they block actual career advancement.</p>\n<p>[14] In certain cases the union acts as a real state structure, for example when it collects applications for internal vacancies in competition with the university secretariat and afterwards tries to have ‘their’ applicants hired.</p>\n<p>[15] In this way SUNPU rescued its raison d’etre: if the workers in the clinics weren’t state employees, but employed by the hospital, SUNPU would not exist. When the workers of the clinics proposed to push for a transfer to the hospital contract, SUNPU tried everything to obstruct this, backed by the union federation Federstatali (to which it belonged).The Collective of Workers and Students at the Policlinico (11th of November 1971) stressed that this obstructive behaviour, apart from showing that SUNPU ‘prioritises’ its own interests to a real unity of workers, reveals the fear of the Federstatali to not only lose a lot of members, but also the only workers who, through their struggles, bestowed it with credibility. In fact, the workers of the clinics have always expressed a high level of combativeness, in spite of the attitude of the union leadership.</p>\n<p>[16] The Collective of Medicine had also always been a stronghold of Manifesto in Rome.</p>\n<p>[17] Later on this attitude transformed itself into an action that was diametrically opposed to the one of the Collective of the Policlinico, even when the solidarity of the students was openly requested. In March 1972, during the course of a struggle against the precarious contracts during which it came to the first internal protest march autonomously organised by the Collective, the hope was that students, hospital and university workers would participate actively in the demonstration against the contracts. “This didn’t happen! […] The hospital and university workers, who were traumatised for too many years by the reformist conditioning of the trade union, were not able to easily do away with the firefighting role of the union activists, while the medical students, in contempt for the proclaimed effort to create a unity with the workers, remained passive and subordinated their action to the institutional terrain of dealings between trade union structures” (10th of March 1972). This boycott repeated itself subsequently during the course of the struggle for the transfer of the hospital from university to the public health administration.</p>\n<p>[18] 2nd of March 1972 – One has also to keep in mind that on the terrain of social struggles, revisionism is more absent, and that this is a fundamental part of the emergence of many autonomous struggles.</p>\n<p>[19] Of course we have to consider that in the worker’s consciousness the problem is often still perceived in its mystified form: it is a daily occurrence to hear workers say that they feel physically bad because they have not taken care or because they are “nervous”. Workers become subjects in this struggle to the extent that their revolutionary consciousness grows and with it their capacity to criticise the revisionist line put forward by the trade union.</p>\n<p>[20] In the leaflet of the Collective of the Policlinico from the 24th of July 1974 a photocopy of a declaration is documented, which had been signed by a group of patients on the 17th of July, in which they state that “they have paid 50,000 Lire to Prof. Aldo Turchetti and that they have subsequently been treated immediately in the medical clinic no.1 directly by him”. This is one of many examples which would come to light during the course of the struggle.</p>\n<p>[21] Therefore it is neither true – as claimed by some comrades – that the auxiliary nurse is a proletarian who struggles against a routinised work, like they do at the assembly line: because the material with which they work is another human being, another proletarian. The struggle against their alienated conditions has therefore to take into account the necessity to join up with the patients. What workers said in the quoted leaflets will be examined further in the text.</p>\n<p>[22] “We have to turn the hospital into a space where the contents of the struggle against toxic working conditions are being circulated in order to come to a unity of struggle for common objectives, in order to destroy the current structure of the hospital and use it not for readjustments and reintegration into the productive cycle, but to create a consciousness amongst ever more vast strata of workers about the close relation between exploitation and illness” (2nd of March 1972)</p>\n<p>[23] In reality, in none of the two cases is the term ‘exploitation’ correct. Regarding the worker, in public hospitals no surplus value is extracted, but rather the state spends here the surplus value created by workers in factories. Neither do the patients produce a surplus value, because they are not active instruments in the hands of the barons, but they are rather inert material that they ‘exploit’ like a raw material. Nevertheless, we continue using these expressions used by the collective because they highlight the antagonism that exists between workers and barons and between patients and barons, and they also help to locate the class enemy inside of public institutions.</p>\n"}},{"node":{"title":"Struggles in the 1970s at the polyclinic in Rome – Part 1","excerpt":"<p>The collective’s outstanding character was based on the fact that it included medical students, nurses, porters and doctors, and aimed at the socialisation of the divided knowledge within a project of workers’ control of the clinic. </p>\n","slug":"struggles-in-the-1970s-at-the-polyclinic-in-rome-part-1","date":"2024-05-09T15:29:20","featuredImage":{"node":{"sourceUrl":"https://vitalsignscontenteditor.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/s-l1200.webp","altText":""}},"author":{"node":{"name":"Angry Workers","firstName":"Angry","lastName":"Workers","avatar":null}},"pdf":{"pdf":null},"categories":{"edges":[{"node":{"name":"History"}}]},"tags":{"edges":[]},"content":"<p><em>We translated <a title=\"this report \" href=\"http://sanita-univ-ricerca.cobas.it/sanita_univ_ricerca/POLICLINICO/LA-NOSTRA-STORIA/GLI-ANNI-70\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">this report </a>on the Collectivo del Policlinico by Graziella Bastelli as part of a series of articles on this historical experience of self-organisation and communist-feminist activity.

The collective’s outstanding character was based on the fact that it included medical students, nurses, porters and doctors, and aimed at the socialisation of the divided knowledge within a project of workers’ control of the clinic. Patients were participating in the regular assemblies of the collective. Workers fought for equal conditions between permanent and precarious staff, they imposed free health services for local workers against the private interests of the bosses of the clinic. The collective supported the occupation of administrative buildings for the establishment of a children’s nursery for hospital workers. They also joined a feminist occupation of an operation theatre for free and safe abortions. The collective was locally linked to similar collectives within the energy sector, railways and various working class neighbourhoods.</em></p>\n<p><em>Our aim as working class militants is to confront these historical examples with the situation today and to contribute to the debate and practice amongst fellow health workers.

She writes about the ‘university workers’ struggles’ for equal wages with the workers directly employed by the hospital – at the time university contracts were used as a form of subcontracts within the hospital, in order to pay less for the same work. So the ‘university workers’ are actually medical workers in the polyclinic.</em></p>\n<p>——–</p>\n<p>It is with immense pleasure that I plunge into the sea of memories… ready to revisit with rationality and emotion the richness and limits of the struggles at the Policlinico Umberto I° in Rome, starting from those distant and often confused 1970s, an era which everyone talks about, but too often only in an individual manner. (…)</p>\n<p>So I went searching through my archives and those of the polyclinic… among photos, leaflets, posters, articles from old newspapers, some were a little faded, others, better preserved by time, could have been written the day before, very topical both in their analyses and in their demands on the right to health. (…)</p>\n<p>I was just savouring the long lapse of time that had passed and all the involutions of the public health system that had so slowly arrived at an enunciation of rights (the Health Reform of ’78), only to then, just as slowly, go backwards where health becomes a commodity, hospitals supermarkets of care, and public health, projected on corporate logic and budget deficits, is suffocated by an invasive and all-encompassing private sector, protected and favoured by all governments/parties/trade unions.</p>\n<p>But this is another story, or perhaps the conclusion of this one, because it demonstrates the need to recount ourselves in order to make memories of the experience and resume being protagonists of the indispensable changes in life, so that we can live it.</p>\n<p>Let us start from the early 1970s, from the Policlinico Workers and Students Collective. Having separated from the comrades who worked in the popular clinic in San Basilio, the collective of medical students and a few workers, more comrade than worker, began to engage in counter-information on the right to health amidst the power, arrogance and scheming of the university barons. We met every Tuesday in an obstetrics clinic lecture hall, and only later did the now famous ‘workers’ lecture hall’ make a triumphant entry into the struggles of the hospital and into the lives of all the workers. Even now, when the eldest among us, those who have not yet been able to retire, pass in front of the general pathology lecture hall built on the glorious lecture hall, an emotional jolt goes through us and memories multiply in our minds and in our stories!</p>\n<p>In the spring of 1971, the comrades of the collective took an active part in the first major mobilisation of university workers, organised by the SUNPU union (national union of university employees). The union was led by a certain Caldarelli who, at the end of the struggle, would ask the workers to ‘give him’ a FIAT 500 for his commitment. The union demanded a salary increase from the university rector, given the frightening difference between the salaries of university workers and those of the employees of the Pio Istituto, also working at the hospital. They all performed identical care duties, working in the university clinics and hospital halls, but received different wages.</p>\n<p>This first struggle lasted three months; university workers only worked the shifts that they were paid for, i.e. the same 8am – 2pm shifts like the public employees. The union imposed an end to the strike after obtaining ‘extraordinary compensation’ and many promises. In the assembly at the rectory where the end of the dispute was formally decided, the comrades of the collective voted against it and began to make themselves known to the workers.</p>\n<p>Assemblies were planned in various hospitals and clinics, assemblies were held with subcontracted workers, with workers from the Tiburtina factories and with the dismissed workers of a private clinic, Villa Domelia.</p>\n<p>During the summer of 1972, the committee for the struggle of day labourers was set up. These were workers who were assigned, almost always without any training, to perform care and cleaning tasks. They were called daily to work in the wards and facility services according to the requests of the ‘head nuns’ and according to the cheese and other earthly offerings they brought as gifts! (Many were peasants.) These workers numbered 272 and together with the comrades of the collective they organised leaflets, mobilisations, meetings with management, even days of strike. One of them, in order to attract the attention of the press and TV, threatened to throw himself off the roof of the paediatric clinic if he was not hired… while the comrades distributed leaflets and organised an assembly in front of the clinic, complete with trumpets! After several months of struggle, the mobilisation of these workers lost steam, while the attempts of the union (the FLO-federation of hospital workers was added to the SUNPU) to demobilise and sell out their demands became increasingly successful.</p>\n<p>By December ’72, only 60 ‘day labourers’ were hired permanently… but with this vanguard that led the struggle, new and combative workers entered the collective. The ‘one-eyed’ (“guercio”) Daniele and the ‘little guy’ (“piccoletto”) Totò, Francone, Ottavio, Albertino, Assunta, Maria Teresa, Il Biondo, Franca, Rosa, Antonione… became the points of reference in the clinics… their life stories intertwined with the desire to become protagonists, for the first time, of the world that revolved around them, but that had never seen or listened to them.</p>\n<p>This new component of the collective, with a good number of medical students, allowed us to spread the collective in almost all of the university clinics: from obstetrics to otolaryngology, to paediatrics, to neuro, to the medical clinics… only the surgical clinics resisted because they were fiefdoms of entire families (fathers, brothers, sons) of trade unionists and PCI members linked to baron-like interests and their clientele privileges. Among the hospital workers who worked on the wards, at the receptions and in the kitchens (400 in all compared to the 1,500 university workers), we managed to make contact with some who, while being interested and helpful comrades during the actual course of the struggles, would later on turn into instruments of provocation and control of the PCI. This we certainly could have anticipated earlier… given that they acted like macho dickheads towards the collective’s female student comrades and their need to be liked at all costs (hairy chests, seductive looks, verbal endorsement to gender equality… while their wives were left at home!). These wretches tried it on constantly, often going so far as to participate in mobilisations and social occasions only in the hope of getting laid… needless to say… they always and constantly ended up rejected, and while the (female) comrades began the arduous road to unmask these opportunists, the (male) comrades, slower and more attached to certain roles and privileges, defended them by recognising their limitations but counting them among the “comrades who must be helped to grow up”!?!!</p>\n<p>In February ’73 we began pushing for free medical services… remember that this was before the health reform, that there were different mutual societies with different health offers, but that we had to pay for everything else… normally the hours of waiting in front of the clinics are nerve-wracking, the patients arrive from 5 a.m. to get their numbers, and suffer harassment and mockery from the super busy ‘gods in white’ in their private clinics who don’t give a damn about the service in the hospital! The comrades of the collective ‘masqueraded’ as patients and started demanding their rights… the other people got involved immediately and after the visits no one paid! Ophthalmologist, obstetrician, ENT… every morning a new health department is organised… the medical barons began to get nervous and realised that the thing is catching on, even without the presence of the comrades of the collective. In the meantime, the collective engaged in counter-information on the various private properties that the doctors owned, on how much time they spent inside their private clinics and how they were ‘ghosts’ at the Polyclinic (where they were formally employed); the comrades mobilised against the so-called ‘pay rooms’… a shameful institution which guaranteed first class care for those with money and which left the poor crammed into the barack-like wards… with a procession of workers they managed to close the pay rooms down!</p>\n<p>In August ’73 the SUNPU trade union agreed with the university rector on a specific pension allowance for state employees… needless to say, it primarily benefited the highly qualified employees while the workers only received a few crumbs!</p>\n<p>In September ’73 the collective contract for hospital workers came up for renewal, and the collective was present in the assemblies. They proposed reductions in working hours and adequate wage increases, opposing the only demand of the trade union, which was the increase in overtime bonus!</p>\n<p>The assemblies at the university clinic also began again. The SUNPU proposed a special allowance; the De Maria allowance also applied to non-hospital staff, as a minimal measure to equalise wages between workers employed by the university and those directly employed by the hospital. The workers rejected this proposal and began to talk about ‘regionalisation’, meaning, the transfer of all university employees working at the Polyclinic to the respective regional collective contract for hospital workers.</p>\n<p>In December 1973, the university workers’ struggle began again – the workers had made clear to everyone that the rector and the trade union were taking the piss, while the workers themselves continued to get starvation wages (a maximum of 50,000 lire a month for university workers compared to the 400,000 of the hospital workers!?).</p>\n<p>Assemblies were organised in all the clinics… and the number of participating workers increased day by day. The unions disassociated themselves from the struggle and condemned it. The workers resumed work only on the reduced 8am – 2pm shift and decided in the assembly how to guarantee the necessary care services so as not to harm hospitalised patients and emergency facilities. Within a few weeks, the 20 workers who had started the mobilisation turned out to be more than a thousand! Every morning, general assemblies were held in the Polyclinic classrooms in which many comrades from the Autonomous Workers’ Committees (comprising ENEL workers from the energy sector; working class squatters and workers who organised the ‘self-reduction’ of rent and other bills; lawyers, etc.) took part. The Workers’ Assembly was formed, which was the only decision-making instrument to carry on the struggle. Negotiations with the various bosses began, and processions were held throughout Rome. The denunciations against the medical barons and their abuses became the direct testimonies of the hundreds of workers who, in daily assemblies, took the courage to shake off the slime that was drowning their right to health and their working dignity!</p>\n<p>From illicit drug testing that used patients as guinea pigs, to corpses locked in refrigerators of the obstetric clinic, to broken lifts, to unusable toilets, to inhuman conditions in the wards, to the cases of corruption and embezzlement by the medical barons, to the denunciation of the murder by two ER doctors, Malizia and Buonaccorsi, who killed a 24 year old woman with a badly executed tracheotomy… the teaching hospital was laid bare and university science was finally presented for what it was: an enormous source of profit to the detriment of the right to health, the duty of teaching, the need for research aimed not at their profit but at the collective good!</p>\n<p>The streets of Rome were invaded by hundreds of workers shouting, “The hospital belongs to the people”, “They exploit us, they kill us, they throw us down the drain and call this health care”, “Workers and sick people united in the struggle”, “Free clinics”, “We are pissed off with barons and unions”, “The boss treats us to exploit us, we will destroy him not to make us sick”, “No to the teaching hospital”… the walls of the Polyclinic were filled with writings and posters recounting the wrongdoings of the various barons, their scheming and interests in the private sector, their abuse of patients and workers.</p>\n<p>The alliance between workers and patients was something tangible, first by involving them together with their relatives in the clinic assemblies where we explained the reasons for our struggle, then with their numerous participation in the general assemblies where they became direct witnesses of the baron-like injustices and oppression, and finally during social events (to choose one example, the performance by Dario Fò in a packed Stefanini hall). After a complaint made in the assembly, a patient was admitted to a surgical clinic instead of being transferred to a private clinic. Others organised themselves in the wards, beginning to claim their rights: from more decent food, to refusing to be used as guinea pigs, with the doctors using treatment as blackmail, to the publication of lists of surgeries that were too often postponed because of the private patients of the various medical barons. Many leaflets were printed on the right to health and all the complaints were publicised in order to curb and control the unconditional power of the barons and their slaves.</p>\n<p>These slaves are the scabs, those totally subservient to baron interests for personal gain (job privileges, second pay in private clinics), many of the trade unionists, and the nuns who, all of them head nurses, are ideal allies of the barons against the sick and the workers.</p>\n<p>The attacks from the trade unions and the left-wing parties, led by the PCI, were not long in coming. It rained denunciations, excommunications and threats to suspend everything so as not to be instrumentalised by ‘the violent few’. As soon as the struggle began, the SUNPU agreed with the rector to give 100,000 lira in advances to university workers… in response, 1,500 workers immediately cancelled their union membership!</p>\n<p>In January 1974, at the suggestion of the barons, the Minister of Education, Malfatti, proposed a small law to put university and regional (hospital) workers on an equal economic footing… the workers’ assembly rejected it!</p>\n<p>In February, the struggle for the free clinics resumed, and the clashes became more and more bitter: some of the barons, in order not to have people demanding free services during their surgeries, called the police and had themselves escorted out of the clinic, others locked themselves inside the rooms, others refused to visit because they ‘felt controlled’… but the workers and users always prevailed and the clinics were guaranteed free to all!</p>\n<p>In February, the police charged against the strikes and workers started blockading the gates of the Polyclinic demanding a legal change to get regional contracts for all university workers.</p>\n<p>The denunciations and arrests began: Francone did a month in jail, there were 4 other arrest warrants and 49 suspects. The mediator arrived, Prof. Biocca, the ‘red baron’ who, because of his PCI history and his ‘honour’, tried – as the rector’s spokesman- to find a solution! He was removed from the assemblies and ‘Biocca Hangman and Jester’ could be read on many of the hospital walls as he scrambled with bucket and paint to clean them up. Without a shadow of a doubt, he personally denounced workers in struggle.</p>\n<p>In April, the law was proposed (which was approved as Law 200) for the transfer of the university workers to the Pio Istituto, a regional body, but it was divided into two articles providing for both economic equality and transfer of employment on demand. Parties, unions, and barons proposed the end of the struggle; the workers decided to remain in assembly until its final approval!</p>\n<p>After five months of struggle, on the 30th of April 1974, the law was approved… the workers celebrated their great conquest, which was certainly not an ambiguous and interpretable law, but their ability to have fought independently against powerful enemies with the strength and justness of their own ideas and rights.</p>\n<p>Subsequently 1,800 workers, or 80% of university employees, demanded a transfer despite the barons’ threats that they would lose their jobs in the clinics and the fact that both university and regional administration created difficulties and obstructions. The Polyclinic workers were very steadfast and tenacious… they were determined not to sell out their struggles and objectives and to maintain their balance of power through direct participation!</p>\n<p>In September ’74  a new struggle began, which had been mobilised for during assemblies of university and hospital workers during the preceding summer: the occupation of the Polyclinic boardroom to win the right as workers to a crèche and nursery school as suitable and welcoming places to take their children while working.</p>\n<p>The current one housed only 40 children between the ages of zero and three, had been declared unfit for use by the provincial doctor, its’ equipment was inadequate and the staffing level was poor. More than 30 mothers organised themselves in shifts during working hours to keep everyone’s children in the hall. The hospital board, frightened by this organisational capacity, proposed to the mothers to stay at home with their children while receiving their salaries, but the mothers preferred to be present in the hospital to start the mobilisation and b face-to-face with the other mothers and all the workers. Wonderful processions with little troublemakers shouting: “We have a president who doesn’t understand anything”. The boardroom of the health directorate was full of drawings, balls and bicycles… after only 8 days, the police charged the occupying mothers and workers, but the occupation resumed and lasted almost a year until they obtained spacious premises and new equipment for both the nursery and the kindergarten outside the hospital walls and with adequate staffing.</p>\n<p>In October ‘74, the trade unions CGIL-CISL-UIL, as they continued to lose ground, had less and less credibility, and were unable to carry on the role of selling out and co-managing, circulated an infamous leaflet against the comrades of the collective, with which they clearly asked the police and the judiciary to intervene. By creating fear and threatening jail, the authorities were supposed to stop the spreading of a practice of self-organisation and direct participation that was involving an increasing number of workers.</p>\n<p>Daniele was arrested for damage, public offense and resistance to a public official, occupation of a public building and criminal association, and his detention, which lasted more than eight months, was particularly harsh. The struggles restarted, the 8-14 shift was resumed, we took to the streets again with marches and demonstrations that, in addition to the usual targets, went to Regina Coeli and the Ministry of Justice to demand freedom for Daniele and the other comrades in jail. The police and the PCI’s anti-strike squads manifested all their rage and violence and the magistracy, through the persecution of Judge Buogo, issued another 6 arrest warrants and 105 notices of offence, which also included 20 mothers who had participated in and managed the boardroom occupation. When the trial was held years later… the Polyclinic workers inaugurated the hall at the Foro Italico where the numerous defendants arrived with their children, bicycles, flyers, pizzas and various sweets… to protest against the fabrication by the barons, the unions and the PCI which target the sacrosanct rights of workers and patients.</p>\n<p>In response to the repression against Daniele, more than 600 workers formally denounced themselves of having committed the same ‘crimes’, reclaiming the struggle and objectives for the right to health. The continuous provocations and jail were not able to bring the workers of the Polyclinic back under the management of the unions and the PCI, because the regained dignity and the desire to decide and count as people in a shared identity meant that the habit of delegation and individual sellouts, the only tool offered by the union practice, had been overcome.</p>\n<p>“We continue to die in hospital… and the conditions of care and those of the workers are still inhuman. In the wards, there are 45 crammed patients and only one nurse, there is the constant obligation to work overtime, the barons continue to be the masters of the hospital and, even if workers now have gained some control, they still use the public beds for their own corrupt interests!”</p>\n<p>From December ’75 the assemblies began to fight against overtime, demanding an increase of 100,000 lira in basic pay and a weekly working time reduction from 40 to 36 hours with full wage compensation! With the transfer of university workers (36 hours) to regional contracts (40 hours) workers demanded to keep the acquired benefits and to extend them to all other employees. Furthermore, there was a demand for shorter work shifts (the famous ‘small shifts’ / ‘turnetti’) so as to eliminate the pressure to work overtime, to have more free time and to be able to work better in order to realise the humanisation of care.</p>\n<p>In February ‘76 we began the actual struggle. In addition to the ex-university workers, many hospital workers were involved, including those in the kitchens and the student nurses. The latter started a regional dispute for the payment of a presalary that spread from the Polyclinic to many other hospitals. The struggle also included the unemployed who, together with all of us, were demanding work and recruitment.</p>\n<p>It was a tradition at the Polyclinic that there were no shortage of attacks from the PCI, and after circulating rambling leaflets full of falsehoods, things became more physical… one of the Party’s district councillors, Sartogo, with a provocation that had been planned beforehand, assaulted Daniele, and the next day the union recruited a hundred people who came from all over Rome to stop ‘the climate of violence and provocation created by the servants of the barons and the fascist thugs of the Policlinico collective’ and there was a harsh clash in front of the gates. Many comrades were injured, many workers were stunned by so much violence, but by now the PCI and the union had no more limits and asked the rector to close the workers’ hall and intensify the repression against those who kept up the fight. Two arrest warrants… two more denunciations by a PCI doctor who was offended at being called an ‘asshole’ resulted in comrades having to go into hiding for months!</p>\n<p>Using words that follow one another on a sheet of paper, I cannot bring to life the intensity of that period, the social cohesion and bonds that these events created and, more than anything else, the profound changes that, individually, all the protagonists were experiencing!</p>\n<p>Close your eyes, put rationality aside and try to give images to my stories…</p>\n<p>On the one hand, there were the comrades with their overall life choices, immersed in ideals who could finally confront theory and practice in the realisation of goals they had considered impossible, who day by day saw and noted changes and felt themselves to be the authors of them…</p>\n<p>On the other hand there were workers with much more concrete needs who were approaching a way of being which was totally different from their previous lives, from the submission by the boss, to the revenge/power over women and children, to the inability to give in in confrontation with others. Their becoming protagonists required a real and tiring change…</p>\n<p>In the daily assemblies, in the demonstrations and even in the clashes with their lifelong enemies… all the participants of this struggle put themselves on the line to walk together towards something different, which fascinated and frightened them at the same time, and to experience an intensity of social connections that was then, as it is now, vital to living!</p>\n<p>Some (female) workers separated from their insensitive husbands who were against their growing and developing; others questioned their relationship and tried to involve their children and wives in this new world; others occupied houses with their comrades in the territories; others participated in the self-reduction of bills; all experienced the anti-fascist struggles first-hand, felt united with all the other exploited, clearly identified their enemies; some gave up because they cannot cope with the intensity and hardness of the commitment; others sell off the work they started with themselves to re-align themselves with a colourless mass… Anyone who remembers those times, whatever their path may be later, speaks of them with passion and the different emotions recounted are all intense and so embodied that they turn… into shared images for the listener!</p>\n<p>Still other images…. it is precisely these collective experiences that allow a specific growth for the (female) comrades and women of the Polyclinic, from being the majority of employees, the most inclined to care and submission, the most blackmailed and abused, to being the most determined and combative, capable of making important decisions when their comrades are arrested, of taking risks in the first person, of being protagonists of the occupation of the nursery, of refusing compromises and blackmail, arriving in June ’78 to organise and coordinate<a href=\"https://www.angryworkers.org/2023/08/31/the-feminist-occupation-of-the-polyclinic-in-rome-in-1978-part-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> the occupation of the maternity ward</a> at the obstetrics clinic. The whole collective took part, but the (female) comrades were the glue between the need expressed by women to open a pregnancy termination ward so as ‘not to have any more (risky and illegal) abortions’ and the rest of the hospital, understood both as a public health service that had to apply a law and as a place of resistances against the self-determination of women, their bodies and their freedom of choice.</p>\n<p>The<a title=\" law 194 \" href=\"http://www.columbia.edu/itc/history/degrazia/courseworks/legge_194.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> law 194 </a>came into effect on the 6th of June ’78 and on the 21st of June a ward was occupied with a well-equipped operating room, which up to that point had always remained unused.</p>\n<p>In the evening, the first four women to have an abortion were accepted, in agreement with a midwife doctor, Enzo Maiorana, and occupied the ward to enforce the law. Naturally, everything was prepared with meetings between the collective and feminist comrades who were already working on abortion and applying the Karman method, that of aspiration, as opposed to scraping, which is much more violent and dangerous for women. We immediately began assemblies in the obstetrics clinic, many women workers from other departments, after their shifts, participated in the ward activities, many comrades from the neighbourhoods and feminists engaged in self-managed consultations, made leaflets and made themselves available to broaden the struggle. They talked about women’s bodies, the right to choose and experience pregnancy, they intervened in the delivery room where women are piled up on stretchers and in the obstetrics clinic wards, claiming the right to a ward for women who have just given birth, they organised meetings with women on contraceptives so that they no longer had to suffer the duty of having a child or the randomness of having one. Some women, after having an abortion, wanted to participate in the occupation and help (female) comrades and workers in the management of the ward, which meant, needless to say, the ostracism of the health management and all the barons ‘disturbed’ in their profession! Births are no longer induced [pilotati] and no woman had to pay for assistance, the Karman method was used to perform abortions and feminist comrades taught the doctors how to perform them (out of 132 doctors, only 8 did not declare their objection to the method and today, although the number of gynaecologists has increased, the non-objectors have been further reduced to 3!) The obstetrics clinic is full of women, (female) comrades, posters and banners… there is a wonderful atmosphere of self-management both of the health facility and of the women’s bodies, all personally involved in their own health.</p>\n<p>On the 3rd of July, the police arrived and there the first eviction took place, followed by the denunciation of 8 comrades for ‘abuse of profession’; they immediately reoccupied and organised themselves to respond to the incessant demand of women who had to have an abortion and were forced to pay for ‘backroom abortions’ because the hospitals did not implement the law. From that date on, the police would garrison the ward day and night for more than a year for fear of a new occupation, and the hospital management would manage it by drastically reducing the number of operations, putting demotivated and tired staff there, and transferring them from the occupied ward to hidden-away rooms with independent entrances, confirming that abortion must remain, in the collective imagination, a disgrace for those who request it.</p>\n<p>By now, the images that my story has produced in your imagination must be overlapping happily, so many faces, so many voices, so many difficulties, so many limitations, so much wealth, so much energy of transformation… it is this baggage that we must reactivate today to defeat, as we did yesterday, albeit with different attacks and new tools, the annihilation violently imposed on our rights to health and life, rediscovering the beauty of sociality, confronting each other on a generational level, and rediscovering that necessary fascination towards change that allows the old to feel young and the young to gain experience to become old!</p>\n<p><strong>Graziella.</strong></p>\n<p><em>now part of Cobas health university and research…</em></p>\n<p><em>before part of the Polyclinic Workers and Students Collective…</em></p>\n<p><em>and always… a comrade!</em></p>\n"}},{"node":{"title":"Militant inquiry into the ‘white factory’ (hospital) – Part one – Wildcat April 1988","excerpt":"<p>We translated this article as a general framework for discussion.

In 1988 comrades in Germany were inspired, in part by the nurses strikes in the USA and the UK during the same year. The age of the text sets limits for its current applicability, but it can help with discussing long-term changes in the sector. It also allows us to share the serious debate of that time. We can think about if the hospital can indeed be classified as a ‘white factory’ or what kind of fundamental differences there are between manufacturing and modern health care. We can also see how many work tasks were pushed down the pay hierarchy towards the lower paid ranks since this article was written. The text mentions that ‘only doctors are supposed to take blood samples’ and that nurses went on a ‘syringe strike’ – today it’s increasingly the job of health care assistants to perform these tasks. Another seemingly dated aspect is the horror with which the comrade saw ‘nursing paperwork’ at the time. They would probably not have dreamt of the fact that today nurses spend their day documenting the ins (medication) and outs (physical measurements) of patients.</em></p>\n<p>The following article is limited to the ‘white factory’, to the hospital as a site of class composition. It implies the thesis that restructuring in the health care system means an attack on those who work there, an attack that reaches far beyond the propaganda of ‘cost containment’. In this first part we won’t elaborate and deepen this thesis on the basis of the upcoming reform of the health care system and we won’t touch on the overall social significance of the health care system and the necessity for fundamental critique of the capitalist concept of illness. This will be dealt with in the second part of the article. That ‘tertiarization’ (the proliferation of ‘services’) means industrialization of services has long been understood by our enemies: their reforms try to contain workers’ antagonistic behaviour that arises with the ‘factory-ization’ of former ‘service work’, such as in hospitals. We think it is urgent to take up the discussion about this area of capitalist reproduction and to develop a practice of militant inquiry and intervention here as well .</p>\n<div class=\"wordads-ad-wrapper\">\n<div id=\"atatags-26942-605306\" data-adtags-width=\"740\"><strong><em>The White Factory</em></strong></div>\n</div>\n<p>Hospital workers’ strikes in Israel, the U.S., and most recently in Britain and Norway have again made us aware that the hospital is also a site of class struggle. Beyond its function as a service provider or even its mystification as a social achievement, the hospital has become a site of surplus value and profit production. In capitalist society, the hospital has always had the function of restoring labor power, of making it available again to the production process, and of weeding out the sick whose labor power cannot be restored. Hospital costs are socially necessary costs. Reducing costs, conversely, helps raise society’s average rate of profit.</p>\n<p>The hospital is the place where the political division of the class into the healthy/able to work and the sick/unable to work is expressed. Those who are (made) incapable of keeping up with the murderous pace of capitalist society are to be isolated from the rest of the class, precisely so that illness means isolation, loneliness, and cannot be turned into a weapon. This is not contradicted by the fact that time and again ways and means are found to reintegrate the disabled into the production cycle. After all, the extremely low wages for work in care homes and in workshops for the disabled make it very attractive.</p>\n<p>In the last ten years, more jobs have been created in the health care sector than have been lost in the construction industry. In other words, the class has been recomposed from above with a push into the service sector.</p>\n<p>Just as the factory, as the most developed point of productive cooperation, allows for the highest rates of surplus value, so the clinic allows for the most stream-lined production of ‘health’ – and the highest degree of social control. As in any place of surplus-value production, we find in the white factory attempts to alter and advance the organic composition, and thus the technical composition, of the exploited labor force. In this context, the sick are consumers of medicines, nursing aids and services and, on the other hand, they are also the material on which the production of ‘health’ is realized. In the outpatient sector, profits have been made from the production of ‘health’ for a long time. Everyone knows doctors and dentists earn good money, but it’s also true that outpatient nursing services, which often already work on a subcontractor basis, are true sources of profit.</p>\n<p>Now the struggles and underlying worker behavior in the hospitals reveal the core of ‘health care’ as industrialization, the clinic as a white factory. What must be discussed first is the question: what is the technical composition and how is it changed? Where do we find fissures and ruptures towards a political recomposition?</p>\n<p>In the following I will try to examine the ‘layers within the hospital’, especially of the nursing staff, and to outline the restructuring of the clinic. Both as a basis for discussion for the militant inquiry, which in the real sense has yet to be taken up.</p>\n<p><strong><em>The hospital</em></strong></p>\n<p>Roughly speaking, a clinic is divided into medical, medical-technical, nursing and support staff. In the report from the USA (Wildcat 43), it is clear that the strike at Kaiser was essentially carried by the medical technicians. They have more to do with the technical side of the clinic and less with the medical or even nursing side, and accordingly the myths of ‘profession as vocation’ or that fighting and caring are a contradiction are less developed among them. In the technical areas of the clinic, normal worker behavior is most likely and most clearly found: the rejection of work. All the more interesting are the struggles in Great Britain, which were very much carried by workers from the care sector.</p>\n<div class=\"wordads-ad-wrapper\">\n<div id=\"atatags-26942-653990\" data-adtags-width=\"740\">In the nursing sector we encounter several peculiarities. First of all, nursing is still treated as a typical female profession, especially with the low pay that is common for it. Most of the nurses are young women; there are few older than 40 in the clinic. Some have children, whom they often have to bring up alone. The very young ones usually have the idea of marrying at some point, then having children and leaving the clinic at least temporarily, if they can afford to. Most stay between two and five, a few up to ten years, then leave the profession or at least change clinics. A few go into nursing leadership, further education, or community nursing. Since outward mobility is already high, along with mobility within the clinic, there is a frantic change and fluctuation of workers. Half of the staff on wards that you return to after a year tend to be replaced by new workers.</div>\n</div>\n<p>Work is usually done in two or three shifts, every other weekend, and work on bank holidays is taken for granted. Overtime is abundant. There has to be at least one registered nurse on the ward per shift, who is responsible for the ward, making rounds, working out and doing all the administrative work. The ward manager and the other registered nurses, if there are any, are mainly responsible for treatment care, dressings, injections and infusions. This is also done by students from higher courses, but is actually part of the doctors’ duties. But they only do it in exceptional cases. Without the nursing staff taking over this work, which is officially not their responsibility, a hospital operation cannot be maintained. A few years ago, there was a ‘syringe strike’ on one of our wards, and within two hours, doctors, nursing staff leadership and hospital management were in an emergency meeting. They managed to subvert the strike. Due to the high turnover and the isolation of the wards from each other, however, word of such conflicts has so far hardly spread and then quickly becomes an individual anecdote.</p>\n<p>Officially, each ward is managed by a ward nurse, the other shift by a side nurse; informally, all registered nurses help managing the ward. This leads to a certain collegiality, but also to the fact that many put up with a lot of stress because they are compensated for it by a leadership function. This blending blurs the hierarchical function of the ward nurse; analyses of hospital administrations speak of the ‘crisis of lower management’, whose ‘democratic’ style is criticized. This is precisely what points towards problems and conflicts that we assess as positive, as a break with the official hierarchy. In ‘lower management’ the managerial position must first be reasserted against this informal collaboration amongst nurses. Roughly speaking, there are two behavioral patterns of certified nurses, which become apparent in the way the ward is managed.</p>\n<p>One sees their role as a mediator between the doctors and the patient/relatives. They try to align their work with that of the doctors. Be it in nursing terms or that they withdraw to the office and administrative area. In their wards, one often finds an unconditional subservience to the doctors, and the pressure on the other workers is very high.</p>\n<p>The second type of behavior is much more common. It is found among certified / registered nurses, who do not know much about charts and curves, and who derive their understanding from the care relation with patients. Of course, this focus on care is used to exert moral pressure to get more and more unpaid extra work. On the other hand, however, there is a relatively pleasant interaction among the workers in such wards, and the internal structure does not put so much pressure on them. This is a thorn in the side of the administrators, because it means that these wards cannot be controlled at will, and the step toward collective refusal is in the air. This behavior is very ambivalent, however, because it conveys the myth of care work.</p>\n<div class=\"wordads-ad-wrapper\">\n<div id=\"atatags-26942-197460\" data-adtags-width=\"740\">This myth is shared by almost all of the graduated nurses who have come to the clinic during the last ten years, because they were told a lot about ‘holistic nursing’ during their training. This conception of ‘holistic nursing’ feeds on three sources:</div>\n</div>\n<p>Firstly, it is linked to the history of those nursing cadres responsible for the education of new nurses; they try to impose a relative autonomy of nursing work and do so by emphasizing its use value, which is a pretty moralistic argument. That’s exactly what’s being pushed in education and training – and those who are pushing it tend to make quick careers in cadre schools and eventually aren’t even found working in hospitals or on the ward.<br />\nSecondly, the myth of holistic care (as care that increases the use value for patients) also makes it easier for you to endure the dissatisfaction, stress, and multiple demands of the white factory.<br />\nAnd thirdly, everyone knows that the new systems of care can only be realized with more staff. Some still hope for the resulting better working conditions. But daily reality proves the opposite: here lies the contradiction from which many develop their criticism of the way patients are cared for and of the factoryization of nursing. A critique from which – even if it is often still individual, limited to small collectives, temporary and defensive – the refusal of ‘factory work’ emerges. This is also where the greatest openness towards a discussion of the nurse-patient relationship can be found.</p>\n<p>The next layer is the health care assistant (HCA); they have one year of training and many of them have been on the ward forever. Their chances of changing jobs are nil because there are now so many certified nurses compared to which the qualification of the HCA is simply too poor. In the 1970s, they were trained en masse, especially women who had already raised their children, in order to get cheap labor into the hospitals quickly. In the real work process on the ward, however, you hardly notice who has the nurse qualification and who ‘only’ has the HCA training. Anyone who works on a ward for more than ten years proves the myth of formal qualifications ad absurdum every day. But ten years on a ward and never at a desk, but always slaving away in the rooms often also leads to a cynical distance from the work; there is no longer any pretension of ‘holistic nursing’ to be found. It becomes a tick-box exercise, you fulfil the tasks that are obvious and that have to be documented, without paying attention to patients in any way – how else would it be possible to run a 30-bed ward with 3-4 workers per shift? The work gets done and that’s it. This cynical distance is also a broad refusal to contribute to the development of the hospital by being sucked into the ‘care’ myth.</p>\n<p>One layer below are the student nurses. Hardly any clinic can work without students. Some of them have worked or studied before, but all of them have worked in care before. During their training, they change jobs at least six times and are often on a ward only for 2-3 months – so they hardly have any time to get to know their colleagues at all.</p>\n<p>What is very clear during the training is that they are used as cheap labor. In most cases, there is no opportunity to learn much, as there is neither time nor personnel for this in the clinic. Sometimes they teach something on the side, but you have to be lucky. Most of the time, students have to do what they already know how to do. For shift work, weekend duty, etc., they are paid 600 to 800 DM. Two years ago, an attempt was made to cut the training pay by 50%, which led to a school boycott at many schools, and the cut was then reduced to 10%. Today, there is no sign of these collective actions and those who carried them.</p>\n<div class=\"wordads-ad-wrapper\">\n<div id=\"atatags-26942-226342\" data-adtags-width=\"740\">Some stop working immediately after the training, using their allowance for being off sick to the maximum (those who are sick during the training for more than 80 days, must do half a year longer). They had other ideas about the work and are now fed up with the impossibility to deliver reasonable care and/or with the shitty working conditions.</div>\n</div>\n<p>Sometimes it is possible to develop groups on the nursing school level that lead an intensive discussion about care work and the hospital world. However, their existence often ends with graduation. Those who stay tend to develop a crazy relationship to their work shortly before the end of the training and during the first months afterward, mediated by their ‘qualification’. For the first time, they find themselves in a situation where they are in charge of a shift, where they can work relatively independently, and where they succeed in creating a space for themselves on the ward. This feeling of qualification, linked to the independent work and the fascination of leadership, is then slowly shattered by the factory and the hierarchy, but this takes time. Or they develop into nursing cadres and continue to qualify until they have escaped the factory organization as teaching nurses or have found their place in the hierarchy as lower managers.</p>\n<p>And then there are the casual assistant workers (bank, agency workers), without whom no clinic can get by. Precarious work in its purest form, they are sometimes called only an hour before the start of duty by the nursing service management or by the ward. Most of them are medical students, with an increasing number of graduates and, increasingly rarely, unskilled workers. They are mainly deployed as care workers, sometimes also as ward assistants. They have no fixed number of hours per month and, of course, no insurance. In some hospitals, their number is very high, e.g., with 500 beds, 20-30 regularly work at night, just as many as permanent employees. On top of that, they are often called in on weekends to keep things ticking over. If they are formally ordered as ‘sitting assistants’ and thus billed via the health insurance, their use is free of charge for the clinic.</p>\n<p>Above all, it’s the students among the extra assistants who do not fight against the shitty working conditions, they pull through the work, slave away and then rest for a while. In part, they are also used deliberately to divide the workforce. In most hospitals, there are what are called ‘permanent casuals’ who work almost constantly; among them are also trained nurses who are used for running the ward.</p>\n<p>Under pressure from health insurances and other ‘payers’, there are almost regular attempts to eliminate extra and ‘sitting assistants’. However, this never lasts very long, either because operations cannot be maintained any other way, or because conflicts arise on the wards when, for example, nurses refuse to take on further responsibility for the ward or stop running errands. Where it is enforceable, work is shifted to the ward, via new shift schedules, increased use of students and overtime. This depends both on the strength of the workers and the number of casual assistants needed, and on the cohesion among them: the longer casual assistants are there and the more frequently they are on a ward, the better the colleagues get along with them. When the number of casual assistants was to be cut in our hospital recently, some of the permanent ward workers refused to do night guard duty on the ward alone. They were blacklisted for this, but at least the divisive measure from management didn’t work out. Casual assistants, who work more regularly, have begun to organize their own work, so that everyone can work the number of hours they need or want to work, and at the times that suit them.</p>\n<div class=\"wordads-ad-wrapper\">\n<div id=\"atatags-26942-216052\" data-adtags-width=\"740\">Among the lowest layers in the hospital are the porters, who can only be found in a few hospitals, because their tasks are disappearing more and more due to centralization and outsourcing (transport workers are of course still there, possibly even more in the future, but no longer in the form of porters). I used to work as a porter myself, my colleagues mostly did their social service (instead of military service) for 2 1/2 years in the clinic. As the name implies, porters have to carry patients, goods, etc. back and forth. The workload is completely different. Sometimes there is no break, sometimes there are up to five hours in the shift to eat, read, drink beer [this must have been Germany in the 1980s! – the translator]. Especially the late shift has a lot of rest in the evening. The porters have a beeper with which they can be reached from all stations. I.e. they can be elsewhere and then be paged. Of course, this has the advantage that no one knows how much work is really being done. On busy days, however, it’s hard to keep up with the demands of the stations. That’s when things start to go wrong, especially between those who have enough to do and can’t keep up with the work. The friction that arises on the wards due to work organization, doctors’ orders, workload, etc. is passed on to the porters.</div>\n</div>\n<p>When the intensity of the work becomes unbearable, it can happen that half of the staff is sick at the same time. In other ways, too, the porters always find gaps in the work organization that they can exploit. In response to their refusal to stay with the patients when they are X-rayed and to being exposed to radiation, they were given dosimeters. The porters in turn hang them over instead of under their lead aprons and thereby soon have the maximum dose which then exempts them from the job.</p>\n<p><strong><em>The lower management</em></strong></p>\n<p>It is precisely in these small conflicts that the mediating function of the ward manager or staff nurse becomes clear: ”Yes, I can understand you, I’ll bring it up at the next meeting …”, the same sayings that you hear from her again and again on the ward. In small hospitals, this mediation function can also be based on the fact that everyone knows each other, that the ward manager or matron used to be a nurse, and that one has worked with her many times. In large clinics, the mediating role comes more from the objective circumstances. Here, too, the ward manager or matron is a qualified nurse, so she knows the area very well. She can therefore act as a representative of the nursing staff vis-à-vis the administration and the doctors – and on the other hand she must enforce their requirements downwards towards the nurses and care workers.</p>\n<p>With increasing factoryization, the traditional method of mediation is coming into crisis. In the small nursing and care homes, matrons and nursing team leaders have always seen themselves more as nurses than as ‘managers’ – and it is precisely through this that they have been able to fulfill their motivating and integrating function. In the ‘white factory’, they increasingly appear to you as the representative of the apparatus who control you and enforce the work-regime, meaning, as the other side; no one would ever think of running to them with all their (personal, professional) problems.</p>\n<p>Despite the sometimes unbearable, destructive working conditions, the work process in the clinic is not yet the same as in a factory. Be it the unpredictability of the workload, the uncontrollability of the work, the lack of motivation of some ward nurses to drive you to work, you always find free space, sometimes you can take it easy for weeks. Of course, all this gets in the way of a profitable clinic. Various attacks are driven to increase the intensity of work and to keep it evenly high over the entire working time.</p>\n<div class=\"wordads-ad-wrapper\">\n<div id=\"atatags-26942-88625\" data-adtags-width=\"740\">The first line is the rationalization of the immediate work process. The work in the hospital is defined and organized in its entirety as a ‘nursing process’; as a nurse, you are no longer supposed to react to complaints or clinic-related illnesses of the patient, but to plan ahead actively. The introduction of ever more elaborate nursing documentation is supposed to provide comprehensive control over all work steps and even over the considerations you make in the process. All in all, this makes nursing care standardizable for the first time, an indispensable necessity for industrializing clinic work.</div>\n</div>\n<p>The second line of action is the centralization of ‘house keeping’ work. On the one hand, this happens internally: cleaning, kitchen and other ancillary work is split off and centralized by hospital-internal bed centers, tray systems, etc. This leads to assembly-line-like work processes, for example when all the beds in a hospital are cleaned and freshly made up in a basement. Politically, this aims to split the labor force into higher-skilled nurses and ‘cleaning and kitchen staff’. Decentralization to the outside world works in a similar way: for years, hospital-owned laundries, cleaning services, kitchens have been privatized and outsourced. It is well known how shitty the working conditions are in such subcontracting and cleaning companies.</p>\n<p>A third line is the privatization of the clinics themselves. This, too, has been known for years in the case of nursing homes and specialized clinics, and has so far meant that ‘the private sector’ has snatched up the most profitable areas. In the future, such principles are now to be applied across the board.</p>\n<p>In summary, we recognize two parallel and contradictory tendencies of rationalization, which must be parallel and contradictory because the worker behavior which they aim to attack and reintegrate carries the same contradictory characteristics: On the one hand, to react to workers’ hatred of work by intensifying the required performance level and through disintegration of the work process (flexibilization, reorganization, new professional categories, outsourcing); on the other hand, hardly any other work like care work is so strongly characterized by ‘usefulness’, and the ‘helper myth’, imposed morals and ethos; there is therefore then an attempt to squeeze out more work by increasing motivation levels (‘holistic care, single room care, documented nursing process).</p>\n<p>The contradictory nature can be discussed exemplarily with the above mentioned ‘crisis of lower management’: on the one hand the ‘inner structures’ in which the ward nurses are rooted are to be decomposed (their relation to other nurses as nurses), on the other hand these structures (the focus on care and personal relations) have to be used or even upgraded in order to generate new motivation. Capital criticizes the ‘democratic style’ of these ward sisters, but wants to preserve its motivating elements and couple them with a hierarchical style to be newly enforced.</p>\n<p>Capital has found a provisional synthesis by introducing a so-called ‘flat rate per case’ (a standardised amount that can be spent on the treatment of specific illnesses and care needs). A combination of rationalization and increased motivation that makes sense for capital has been created in the USA. There, the DRG (Diagnosis Related Groups) were introduced in 1983 and with it a case-related flat rate payment. The basis for cost accounting in hospitals is no longer a daily rate or services actually rendered, but a flat rate depending on the diagnosed illness. This is where economic and patient-centered care concepts intertwine.</p>\n<div class=\"wordads-ad-wrapper\">\n<div id=\"atatags-26942-210984\" data-adtags-width=\"740\">The article from which the following quotations are taken represents part of the discussion on the way in which performance- and productivity-based payment can be introduced in German hospitals. In addition to trial runs, it is recommended to introduce the system slowly for particular diagnoses, particular care services and/or specific hospitals hospitals, in order to adapt it to the requirements.</div>\n</div>\n<p>DRGs are ‘flat rates per case’, (they) represent a classification system that assigns patients to certain diagnosis categories upon the patient’s admission, depending on the diagnosis. These categories are then related to a prospective payment system that assures a flat rate that is fixed in advance. If the patient is discharged before this sum is exhausted, the hospital can retain the difference. So it also makes a corresponding profit on the sale of the commodity ‘health’, because “this system sees hospitals as multi-product businesses whose ‘production’ is the number and type of patients treated.”</p>\n<p>Moreover, “it forces hospital management to be guided by market principles. This management and care strategy has the effect of both shortening the length of stay and decreasing occupancy rates, but it increases the intensity of care.” Therefore, “what is needed is not fewer, but at least a similar, and possibly even a higher, number of qualified nurses.” But it’s not as simple as hiring more people, “because of reduced occupancy, it’s economically necessary for hospital management to critically review the overall staffing level.” The goal is to manage the increased nursing intensity with higher labor intensity.</p>\n<p>“The basis for the economic success of the nursing service is the rational use of people, time and materials.” “The new economic background determines the temporary deployment of nurses to a neighboring ward.” And to make sure everyone understands, “the economic significance of absenteeism is explained to nurses.” In order to appear not just as another cost-cutting process, the project is backed up by ‘occupational science’.</p>\n<p>It is here that the much-discussed introduction of care processes and nursing documentation comes into its own. “Care documentation forms the indispensable data basis for realistic care management.” This is because “productivity and quality evidence is based on the data obtained from care documentation. The data gathered in the course of care work forms the basis for management decisions, in order to be able to adapt the personnel and additional expenditure to the changed situations in an economically efficient way.” “But the productivity record makes no statement about the quality of care.” After all, it’s not just productivity that should be monitored, but quality as well.</p>\n<p>“Generally, after patients are discharged, a nursing audit, a nursing control, is performed for selected diagnostic category by a group of nurses delegated for this purpose. One hundred percent achievement of the criteria is targeted. Those medical records that fall short are examined in detail. Depending on the causes of non-attainment of nursing criteria, corrective action or educational programs are initiated.” But “the multi-layered changes cannot be managed by the nursing management alone. It must therefore mobilize all those working in nursing and sensitize them emotionally and rationally to the new reality through educational work.” And “in doing so, it is important to emphasize the professional challenge of the individual as well as the collective opportunity of nurses to contribute productively to the economic success of the nursing service in the narrower sense and the hospital in the broader sense.” And for this purpose, “each nursing unit is set up by the administration as a cost center Performance recording lists, which express the performance status in monetary terms, are indispensable instruments for economically efficient management.”</p>\n<div class=\"wordads-ad-wrapper\">\n<div id=\"atatags-26942-909651\" data-adtags-width=\"740\">Nor does the role of the patient fall merely to the ‘product’ to be processed; “satisfied patients are the most effective and cheapest advertising.” Therefore, workers “should identify with their hospital, which has quality to offer and market.” Whether they do so sufficiently is “statistically assessed by evaluating patient satisfaction forms.” These “point the way for corrective action.” So much for the effects of DRG in the hospital, “The consequence is that patients are discharged faster and sicker than before. Thus, it is relatively common that, after discharge from the hospital, large wounds have to be treated, multiple decubitus treated, nutrition continued by gastric or gastrotomy tube, tracheostomies (artificial windpipes) suctioned, and infusions monitored and replaced.” And this only allows the patient to increase profits, as “the number of home care agencies (has) increased 25% from 1984 to 1985.” (all quotes from “The Nurse” 2/88)</div>\n</div>\n<p><strong><em>Clinic, patient and class struggle</em></strong></p>\n<p>Up to this point we have analyzed the hospital as a white factory, including the attack on its class composition, and the restructuring process into a profitable service sector, but we must now address an essential difference from the factory. A difference that makes the struggles much more difficult: The ‘material’ that hospital workers work on are the patients, people who want their claim to help and relief, their claim to be human, redeemed. Therefore, common forms of struggle are not applicable in the service factory for the time being. Of course, it is possible to destroy parts here and there, to rip off care materials, to sabotage the administration, but sabotage of the machine and the product is not possible for the time being. There were hardest strikes in Israel, where in the end even emergency admissions were denied, but that is an exception.</p>\n<p>And unlike the ordinary factory, the ‘material’ also puts pressure on you. Patients have wants and needs, not to mention necessities that must be met. This means that they increase your workload, which leads many nurses to blame the patients more or less openly for a shitty day, to develop hatred for patients instead of criticizing the work organization, i.e. the real causes. This leads to the absurd situation that nurses let patients feel their power: Immobilizing uncomfortable patients or unnecessary catheterization are measures against the patient, which are more common the more work there is on the ward.</p>\n<p>Third, nurses have to balance and mediate the incompatibility between patients’ expectations of healing and medicine’s terror of healing. Many patients want help and pain relief and repeatedly place all their trust in hierarchical, selective medicine. Out of this attitude they sometimes accept the total terror of doctors up to experiments on them and are silent towards the doctors, out of fear or respect. If, then they defend themselves only opposite the implementing nursing staff. Often one is then in the situation to have to fix patients, to forcefully enforce the examination, or, on a lower level, to have to answer the patients’ questions, which actually should have been clarified by the doctor.</p>\n<p>A united front of nurses and patients can only be established when patients address their illness themselves, and nurses turn their power over patients around.</p>\n<p>As long as hospital workers do not address illness in a revolutionary way in their struggles, they will always be locked in the ambivalence between refusal of work and use-value of work. And in this ambivalence they will again and again only advance the development of the white factory.</p>\n<div class=\"wordads-ad-wrapper\">\n<div id=\"atatags-26942-361563\" data-adtags-width=\"740\">There will be much work to be done here.</div>\n</div>\n"}}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
