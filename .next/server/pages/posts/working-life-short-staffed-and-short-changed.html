<p>In this series we ‘ll look at how our work and the conditions of work change. Back in the day only doctors would take blood, in some European countries that is often still the case. Nowadays lower paid HCAs are trained to take blood &#8211; in April 2024 the temporary staffing office of the hospital with the slow lifts put out a Band 2 vacancy with required venepuncture experience which makes venepuncture a zero-hours minimum wage task. Certain job roles become very specific. Phlebotomists walk through the hospital all day and take blood, because that’s supposed to be “more efficient”, even if it makes you feel like part of a conveyor belt. New technologies are introduced that are supposed to reduce labour elsewhere. In one of the hospitals, management invested in automated transport platforms (“Attention, automatic transport!”). This would have made a number of waste or linen porters redundant if these platforms weren’t so high maintenance. Now perhaps only 3 out of 15 of them still work. At the other hospital, management invested in PDAs (basically IPhones) for porters, so that they don’t have to return to the lodge, but can be given one job after the other. They also had to find out that algorithms are actually not always more efficient. It takes a while to know all the short-cuts in that maze.</p>
<p><i>“What with the staffing shortage and the long shifts, the only pleasure in life that I have left ends with the letter ‘x’&#8230; Datix”. </i></p>
<p>We are interested in the changes at work, because this is where we spend most of our lives. A change can mean more stress or less stress. It can make our job more boring or more interesting. It might lead to job cuts. In the end it is about understanding how our work is organised in order to have more control over it together. People who feel that they lack control become depressed. But understanding is nothing without the power to challenge certain changes or to propose our own, in our and the patients’ interest. We have to live up to this responsibility together. When we look at how work is organised we will also see that we depend on the work of hundreds in order to be able to do our work properly. In the NHS everything seems so divided into thousands of job roles and pay bands. This hides that a nurse can’t do her job without the domestic or housekeeper, the doctor not without the porter or canteen worker. And this reaches way beyond the hospital walls. Remember the supply-chain crisis, when we couldn’t get wet wipes or Tazocin? And what is the ‘community care crisis’, if not a lack of staff, which then means that patients have to stay in hospital longer then they would normally need to.</p>
<p><i>“This has increased the staffing shortage &#8211; and being short-staffed on long days really sucks, your life becomes the equivalent of a sluice room.”</i></p>
<p>For this issue of Vital Signs we asked colleagues in different jobs to tell us how staffing shortage affects them. In the public this is mainly discussed as a problem of nurses, but it is actually a problem of everyone. And it is a funny problem, as there isn’t actually a shortage of staff, but a lack of will to pay more and to hire more people. Instead of doing a heavy hospital job, people work in bullshit jobs, which might make no sense whatsoever in human and social terms, but which pay the bills and are bearable. Perhaps 40% of jobs in this society can be categorised as bullshit jobs, as work which makes no one’s life any better. If we would organise things together and consciously, we could redistribute loads of work and only work half as much. This would leave more time for creativity and relationships. But where money rules, common sense goes out of the window. Instead we are in a Catch22 situation. How many NHS workers are on long-term sick leave due to stressful working conditions and have appointment after appointment cancelled because the NHS is “overstretched”. Write to us with your own experiences and thoughts.</p>
<p>These are examples from the two big hospitals in Bristol…</p>
<p>Catering worker: “It’s a weird one. We don’t have enough staff to do the washing up in the staff canteen. So we hand out paper plates. At the same time management is not requesting more bank staff. The queues are getting longer, in particular for the morning bacon baps and on a fish-and-chips day”.</p>
<p>Pharmacy worker: “It’s kinda the same as everywhere else. Instead of having people doing specific things, they expect everyone to be doing a bit of everything but not as well. It feels like we’re short staffed from top to bottom, with pharmacy technicians filling in for a shortage of pharmacists and pharmacy assistants filling in where the pharmacy technicians were, to some extent. If there aren’t enough pharmacists or pharmacy technicians on the wards it takes longer for people to get their TTAs. There aren’t enough people in distribution to make sure all the wards get the top ups they need so they have to wait a day for stuff they need, which means patients might have to go the night without the drugs they’re relying on. And then because it seems a bit unmanageable, people tend to leave pretty quick which means they’re constantly relying on overtime to fill the gaps. It seems a bit unsustainable to be honest”</p>
<p>General porter: “Before we had separate tasks, now management wants everyone to work everywhere, from ED to general patient transport, from linen to waste. They think that they can cope with staffing shortages better when everyone is more flexible. But now we have situations where we do clinical waste in the morning, because the linen arrives late, and then distribute fresh linen. This can’t be good for infection control, can it.”</p>
<p>Domestics: “When there is a staff shortage you might have to do more tasks during your shift. On a certain ward you might only be supposed to do a green clean, meaning, changing the bin bags. But if they couldn&#8217;t find a replacement for your colleague who is off sick you might also have to do the general clean, on top of the other tasks”.</p>
<p>Bank HCA: “The ups and downs of shift availability is extreme and doesn’t seem to correspond with actual demand on the wards. For a while they cancelled loads of shifts and there were not enough shifts available to make ends meet. But you heard that the situation on the wards was not good. A couple of weeks later the Bank office texts you every 5 minutes and offers 50% uplift for allocation on arrival. From the outside it seems very chaotic. I work in both hospitals. In one hospital you have on average 5 to 6, in the other one 8 to 9 patients. That doesn’t sound like a big difference, but it can really decide if you &#8211; and the patients! &#8211; have a good or a shit day. If you have time to really get to know a patient and connect with them or not”.</p>
<p>Ward nurse: “I don’t know if that is related to staffing shortage, but somehow it probably is. In one of the wards where you have a lot of confused patients they now start a trial of video streaming of patients. I don’t think that they will replace 1:1 care for so-called ‘ECO4’ patients (patients who need constant attention), but it will undermine the demand for better staffing levels in the long run. What with the staffing shortage and the long shifts, the only pleasure in life that I have left ends with the letter ‘x’&#8230; Datix”.</p>
<p>HCA (or HCSW or NA): “Some years ago they changed the shift-system for HCAs from 8-hour shifts to 12-hour shifts. In that way management hoped to achieve two things: they would save 30 minutes hand-over time per day and they would need less people overall. Some people like the 12-hour shifts, because you have more days off, but with the inflation a lot of people work extra bank-shifts anyway. Sickness levels have gone up since then and a lot of older people left, because they can’t hack the 12-hours. This has increased the staffing shortage &#8211; and being short-staffed on long days really sucks, your life becomes the equivalent of a sluice room. Around a similar time they introduced bank shifts, which also meant that instead of overtime, which is paid time and a half, people were now working casual shifts on the same wage.”</p>
<p>Housekeeper: “As a housekeeper you notice when there are not enough nurses or HCAs. And they notice if the housekeeper is off sick and not replaced. This might decide over the question if patients get washed or not and if they get their meals still hot or cold. But it can get even more serious than that. We had so many more patient falls when we were understaffed. They can’t wait for ages if they need the loo. We try to help each other, but there is a human limit”.</p>
<p>Scrub nurse: “A lot of permanent theatre staff left their jobs, these were experienced scrub nurses and operating department practitioners (ODPs). Management had to replace them with agency staff, many of whom had worked as permanent staff here before. I would say up to 30% of theatre staff is employed through agencies, but it is difficult to tell, because we all work together day in, day out. From April 2024 management wants to cut the jobs of many of the agency colleagues. I just fear that we get back into a cycle where surgeons get stressed, because new staff might lack certain knowledge, this then creates a bad atmosphere and people leave &#8211; and in the end management has to call the agency back. Perhaps we should send a collective letter to management in which we question their decision. Another way in which we notice staff shortage is with the sterilising service from the CSSD. When they are short-staffed, the turnaround of sterile instrument sets can take too long. We already had to cancel surgeries because we didn’t have the right sets.”</p>

Back in the day only doctors would take blood, in some European countries that is often still the case. Nowadays lower paid HCAs are trained to take blood \u0026#8211; in April 2024 the temporary staffing office of the hospital with the slow lifts put out a Band 2 vacancy with required venepuncture experience which makes venepuncture a zero-hours minimum wage task. Certain job roles become very specific. Phlebotomists walk through the hospital all day and take blood, because that’s supposed to be “more efficient”, even if it makes you feel like part of a conveyor belt. New technologies are introduced that are supposed to reduce labour elsewhere. In one of the hospitals, management invested in automated transport platforms (“Attention, automatic transport!”). This would have made a number of waste or linen porters redundant if these platforms weren’t so high maintenance. Now perhaps only 3 out of 15 of them still work. At the other hospital, management invested in PDAs (basically IPhones) for porters, so that they don’t have to return to the lodge, but can be given one job after the other. They also had to find out that algorithms are actually not always more efficient. It takes a while to know all the short-cuts in that maze.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e“What with the staffing shortage and the long shifts, the only pleasure in life that I have left ends with the letter ‘x’\u0026#8230; Datix”. \u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are interested in the changes at work, because this is where we spend most of our lives. A change can mean more stress or less stress. It can make our job more boring or more interesting. It might lead to job cuts. In the end it is about understanding how our work is organised in order to have more control over it together. People who feel that they lack control become depressed. But understanding is nothing without the power to challenge certain changes or to propose our own, in our and the patients’ interest. We have to live up to this responsibility together. When we look at how work is organised we will also see that we depend on the work of hundreds in order to be able to do our work properly. In the NHS everything seems so divided into thousands of job roles and pay bands. This hides that a nurse can’t do her job without the domestic or housekeeper, the doctor not without the porter or canteen worker. And this reaches way beyond the hospital walls. Remember the supply-chain crisis, when we couldn’t get wet wipes or Tazocin? And what is the ‘community care crisis’, if not a lack of staff, which then means that patients have to stay in hospital longer then they would normally need to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e“This has increased the staffing shortage \u0026#8211; and being short-staffed on long days really sucks, your life becomes the equivalent of a sluice room.”\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor this issue of Vital Signs we asked colleagues in different jobs to tell us how staffing shortage affects them. In the public this is mainly discussed as a problem of nurses, but it is actually a problem of everyone. And it is a funny problem, as there isn’t actually a shortage of staff, but a lack of will to pay more and to hire more people. Instead of doing a heavy hospital job, people work in bullshit jobs, which might make no sense whatsoever in human and social terms, but which pay the bills and are bearable. Perhaps 40% of jobs in this society can be categorised as bullshit jobs, as work which makes no one’s life any better. If we would organise things together and consciously, we could redistribute loads of work and only work half as much. This would leave more time for creativity and relationships. But where money rules, common sense goes out of the window. Instead we are in a Catch22 situation. How many NHS workers are on long-term sick leave due to stressful working conditions and have appointment after appointment cancelled because the NHS is “overstretched”. Write to us with your own experiences and thoughts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese are examples from the two big hospitals in Bristol…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCatering worker: “It’s a weird one. We don’t have enough staff to do the washing up in the staff canteen. So we hand out paper plates. At the same time management is not requesting more bank staff. The queues are getting longer, in particular for the morning bacon baps and on a fish-and-chips day”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePharmacy worker: “It’s kinda the same as everywhere else. Instead of having people doing specific things, they expect everyone to be doing a bit of everything but not as well. It feels like we’re short staffed from top to bottom, with pharmacy technicians filling in for a shortage of pharmacists and pharmacy assistants filling in where the pharmacy technicians were, to some extent. If there aren’t enough pharmacists or pharmacy technicians on the wards it takes longer for people to get their TTAs. There aren’t enough people in distribution to make sure all the wards get the top ups they need so they have to wait a day for stuff they need, which means patients might have to go the night without the drugs they’re relying on. And then because it seems a bit unmanageable, people tend to leave pretty quick which means they’re constantly relying on overtime to fill the gaps. It seems a bit unsustainable to be honest”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGeneral porter: “Before we had separate tasks, now management wants everyone to work everywhere, from ED to general patient transport, from linen to waste. They think that they can cope with staffing shortages better when everyone is more flexible. But now we have situations where we do clinical waste in the morning, because the linen arrives late, and then distribute fresh linen. This can’t be good for infection control, can it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDomestics: “When there is a staff shortage you might have to do more tasks during your shift. On a certain ward you might only be supposed to do a green clean, meaning, changing the bin bags. But if they couldn\u0026#8217;t find a replacement for your colleague who is off sick you might also have to do the general clean, on top of the other tasks”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBank HCA: “The ups and downs of shift availability is extreme and doesn’t seem to correspond with actual demand on the wards. For a while they cancelled loads of shifts and there were not enough shifts available to make ends meet. But you heard that the situation on the wards was not good. A couple of weeks later the Bank office texts you every 5 minutes and offers 50% uplift for allocation on arrival. From the outside it seems very chaotic. I work in both hospitals. In one hospital you have on average 5 to 6, in the other one 8 to 9 patients. That doesn’t sound like a big difference, but it can really decide if you \u0026#8211; and the patients! \u0026#8211; have a good or a shit day. If you have time to really get to know a patient and connect with them or not”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWard nurse: “I don’t know if that is related to staffing shortage, but somehow it probably is. In one of the wards where you have a lot of confused patients they now start a trial of video streaming of patients. I don’t think that they will replace 1:1 care for so-called ‘ECO4’ patients (patients who need constant attention), but it will undermine the demand for better staffing levels in the long run. What with the staffing shortage and the long shifts, the only pleasure in life that I have left ends with the letter ‘x’\u0026#8230; Datix”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHCA (or HCSW or NA): “Some years ago they changed the shift-system for HCAs from 8-hour shifts to 12-hour shifts. In that way management hoped to achieve two things: they would save 30 minutes hand-over time per day and they would need less people overall. Some people like the 12-hour shifts, because you have more days off, but with the inflation a lot of people work extra bank-shifts anyway. Sickness levels have gone up since then and a lot of older people left, because they can’t hack the 12-hours. This has increased the staffing shortage \u0026#8211; and being short-staffed on long days really sucks, your life becomes the equivalent of a sluice room. Around a similar time they introduced bank shifts, which also meant that instead of overtime, which is paid time and a half, people were now working casual shifts on the same wage.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHousekeeper: “As a housekeeper you notice when there are not enough nurses or HCAs. And they notice if the housekeeper is off sick and not replaced. This might decide over the question if patients get washed or not and if they get their meals still hot or cold. But it can get even more serious than that. We had so many more patient falls when we were understaffed. They can’t wait for ages if they need the loo. We try to help each other, but there is a human limit”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eScrub nurse: “A lot of permanent theatre staff left their jobs, these were experienced scrub nurses and operating department practitioners (ODPs). Management had to replace them with agency staff, many of whom had worked as permanent staff here before. I would say up to 30% of theatre staff is employed through agencies, but it is difficult to tell, because we all work together day in, day out. From April 2024 management wants to cut the jobs of many of the agency colleagues. I just fear that we get back into a cycle where surgeons get stressed, because new staff might lack certain knowledge, this then creates a bad atmosphere and people leave \u0026#8211; and in the end management has to call the agency back. Perhaps we should send a collective letter to management in which we question their decision. Another way in which we notice staff shortage is with the sterilising service from the CSSD. When they are short-staffed, the turnaround of sterile instrument sets can take too long. We already had to cancel surgeries because we didn’t have the right sets.”\u003c/p\u003e\n"},"posts":{"edges":[{"node":{"title":"NHS pay dispute from below – Online newsletter no.4 / 2021","excerpt":"\u003cp\u003eWelcome to the fourth newsletter for a worker-led pay dispute from below\u0026#8230;\u003c/p\u003e\n","slug":"nhs-pay-dispute-from-below-online-newsletter-no-4-2021","date":"2024-05-09T15:24:03","featuredImage":{"node":{"sourceUrl":"https://vitalsignscontenteditor.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/60022.jpg","altText":""}},"author":{"node":{"name":"Angry Workers","firstName":"Angry","lastName":"Workers","avatar":{"url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a0f27e536deb935b37f956e7bad75489?s=96\u0026d=mm\u0026r=g"}}},"categories":{"edges":[{"node":{"name":"Current Struggles"}}]},"tags":{"edges":[]},"content":"\u003cp\u003eThe main healthcare unions have spent the last 6 weeks consulting their members on the 3% pay ‘rise’, which has now trickled into some workers’ September wage slip. While members who did vote overwhelmingly rejected the offer, across the board, turnout was very low – too low in all but some GMB Southern Region trusts to win a mandate for industrial action legally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis was predictable. Even though staff are pissed off, they are not being spurred into self-activity, nor even actively demanding the union does something. Getting a higher turnout would have required an all- guns-blazing strategy of mobilisation from the unions, and there seemed to be only a few firecrackers going off!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFrom a Unite healthcare worker:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Unite’s ‘Day of Action’ in August was a damp squib – we got one email a week beforehand asking us to organise a hospital protest but no reps responded. When I tried to push it with the regional officer, I was referred to the main rep who was on holiday. Other Unite members in other parts of the country were told it was more of an ‘online event’. Unite used an online balloting system, supposedly for the first time, meaning you had to wait for an email to appear from them in your inbox before you could click on a link to vote. When I didn’t receive mine, I had to chase up, and was told that because I didn’t tick on a certain mailing preference box when I signed up, the ballot email wasn’t sent out to me. The whole thing meant that if I didn’t have an active and proactive interest in knowing what was going on and wanting to vote, the whole thing would have slipped me by…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFrom a Unison healthcare worker:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“At our branch we relied primarily on emailing and texting individual members to mobilise them to a ‘drop-in’ in a tent in the hospital car park. Not many people attended, perhaps a dozen on each of the three drop-in dates, out of a total workforce of nearly 9,000 and a Unison membership of over 2,000. Even perks like £5 canteen vouchers weren’t enough to get the punters in! Proposals to organise a joint-union protest rally in front of the hospital were rejected. It seemed that the RCN had the same problems at their stalls at a different, and remote corner of the hospital.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFrom an RCN healthcare worker:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“…members’ events I’ve been to have been encouraging – nurses rallying outside hospitals. It was cool to see RCN and Unite nurses/members coming together for these. Some have also involved local lobby groups. Official union events have been more often organised with and for workers at specific trusts. So closed meetings inside hospitals, out of public view – with stalls set up for visiting heads (including reps from local government) to speak with members and answer questions – this put me off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt (online) meetings I’ve found contributions from nurses involved in past actions helpful – particularly members who got involved with the Northern Ireland strikes in 2019. More recently there’s been celebration of voter turnout and response, stoking momentum – but to read/hear that members have “voted overwhelmingly against” 3% feels hard to reconcile with the 25% turnout, and how things feel at work. I’ve shared campaign materials where I’m based (in a community mental health team) and uptake has been supportive, but limited. There’s only a couple of nurses in the team active with a union, and only half the team are employed by the NHS (half work for the council/local authority) – so as yet, the pay campaign hasn’t felt the most shared, relevant thing we’ve had going on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRCN have been less vocal than other unions about joined-up actions, but I think this could really help. Now unionised council-employed workers are beginning to ballot too, I’m hoping this leads to more discussions and ideas about ways we can support each other across the sectors”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo what happens next? Only GMB is going ahead with a proper industrial ballot at this point. Despite not meeting the thresholds that would be needed to actually go on strike, all of the rest of the unions (aside from RCM) are pushing ahead with an indicative ballot for industrial action. This involves asking their members if they want to actually take industrial action – even though some of them already captured that data in their first ballot (Unison, Unite), or despite the fact that they could have asked in their first ballot (RCN). While unions might think they need all these ballots to ‘build momentum’, the more likely result is to lose it…And if we go on the efforts of their last ballot ‘engagement strategy’, there is nothing to indicate more people will vote this time round…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis article from a NHS trade unionist spells out why successful industrial action is unlikely under the current arrangements. Basically, in order to enforce a pay rise, we would need more coordinated action across the unions, which would mean common demands amongst a divided workforce – divisions that are perpetuated by the unions who are only interested in ‘their’ members. So where does that leave the huge anger amongst workers about the measly 3%?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnite, with their new General Secretary, are making noises about ‘coordinated and targeted actions’ within the NHS. This is an attempt to ‘work with what’s there’ – which, in a workforce as divided as the NHS, seems like a pragmatic step forward, unlike the Royal College of Midwives, who seem to have given up the ghost entirely. We need real worker engagement – which will only happen if the unions are able to relinquish some control, for the full-timers to not worry about pissing off senior NHS managers, and foster a strategy towards worker self-activity that means that we can directly affect our work on a day-to-day level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePay rise? What pay rise?!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeople have largely now been given the backdated ‘pay rise’, but many complain that they actually have less in their pocket. After inflation, a planned National Insurance increase, and rising energy bills, the 3% quickly disappears and we’re in a situation where we’re actually paying out more than before!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“My job role is a Clinical Specialist (Nurse)’ at AfC band 6.

I took home £1,256.4 per month last year, which has gone up to £1,285.03 this year – so an increase of £28.63 a month or about 2.3%.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“…my pension rate was put up to the next band, which based on my new basic pay, would be incorrect and that’s taken pretty much all my back pay. This had all meant that my take home pay last month was roughly £200 less than normally is. A lot of my colleagues have had a similar thing happen…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m a band 2 housekeeper, I was on a ‘training wage’ i.e. for new starters before they get their care certificate, being paid 75% of my regular wage. I was expecting the 3% increase because I am a permanent NHS worker, doing the job as it’s supposed to be done, but didn’t get it. I rang up HR and they gave me some bull about how I wasn’t entitled to it…”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBristol – Wages of arbitrariness\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile so far the pay campaign has been fairly tame at our Trust wage divisions within the Trust start to surface. As a result of the national dispute about whether unsocial hour bonuses should be included into pay for annual leave or not it became apparent that workers’ conditions are very different within the same Trust, depending on where people work. In some departments and amongst some professional groups, such as porters, workers are able to work overtime on 1.5 pay rate, whereas in other departments workers are only given the option to work bank shifts on significantly lower rates. This is not an open dispute, it is still negotiated behind closed doors. A second wage division opened up between regular workers and those who are on training and apprentice contracts. The Trust decided to exclude them from the 3% pay increase and back dated payments, as the apprentices ‘already receive the statutory minimum wages’, which was increased last year. Apprentices and ‘trainees’, who largely do the same job as everyone else, apart from very occasional training sessions, are not too happy about this. Even Sodexo agreed to pay the 3% increase to outsourced workers in South Yorkshire!!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThoughts of a midwife…\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe gap between those that rejected the 3% pay offer and those that voted in favour of industrial action was the widest amongst Royal College of Midwives (RCM) members (95% compared to 54%). Why is this? Discontent seems to be at the highest recorded rate amongst all groups of NHS workers, at the same time that willingness to strike to enforce a higher wage does not. While any kind of patient care makes it difficult to contemplate strike action, the nature of midwifery means that timely responses are totally inflexible. If a woman is giving birth, not attending to her and risking the death of mother and baby is something no midwife wants to have on their conscience. What can be done instead? This is an open question that would need midwives to collectively discuss where and how they can wield some power – with no impact on mother and baby.

The the internal consultations of the various unions about whether or not to engage in industrial dispute over the 3% pay decision by the government are drawing to a close. As health workers who take active part in the pay campaign we think that the most likely outcome is that the unions will announce that their members didn’t give them the mandate to mobilise for industrial action. This doesn’t mean that the dispute is over for us! The work-stress and low pay will continue and we will continue finding ways to confront this dismal situation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e* Both trust management and unions will say that they cannot do anything about pay and staffing levels, as these are allegedly ‘national issues’. This is not true. Trust management can find money to increase bank pay during certain periods, such as the summer holidays, or pay certain groups of workers more for ‘recruitment and retaining’ purposes. If your local union branch – or you as a collective of workers! – wanted you could engage in official industrial dispute over these pay issues on a trust level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e* There is a huge gulf between the low participation rate of workers in the union ballots and the mass of people who leave the job because they had enough! People are angry, but the unions are too far removed from the day-to-day on hospital wards and in the community health centres. As some of the reports in this newsletter show, the individual trade unions rather engage in pretty pathetic separate pay campaign activities, such as remote drop-ins, than visible joint rallies!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet’s not give up hope in either way: there might still be enough people willing to vote for industrial action – and if not it just means that we have to find new forms to fight for better conditions for workers and patients!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor people who, like us, have difficulties to get their head around how the whole pay increase issue works we have summarised the basics below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe need to share our experiences, please send us your ideas and observations: healthworkersunited@protonmail.com\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e———\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e* Comments from Birmingham\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I discuss the pay campaign there is general agreement that yeah the “3%” is an insult and yeah you shouldn’t stand for it and yeah strike action seems pretty reasonable under the circumstances. Then comes what you have been expecting and dreading “Nurses can’t go on strike”. I ask why and get all the answers you’d expect:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Nurses in the UK have never been on strike” – Not true. Nurses in Northern Ireland successfully went on strike in 2019/2020 over not getting a pay rise in line with the rest of the UK but they tells me they don’t count, it’s not really part of the UK. Well that might be true you think in an abstract sense but that’s another argument. However it does seem to reflect a way people feel, we can’t do it because we never have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“What about patient safety, they’ll die if we do” – I point out that they’ll die if we don’t, more and more nurses will leave the profession and less new ones will join. We’ve already got a nursing crisis and this will only make it worse. Any way the Northern Irishes strike was able to be done safely and nurses around the world have managed many times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We’re the most trusted profession in the UK. We can’t ruin that.” – I ask what’s good trust if we’re not respected. They says we are. You say does 3% feel like respect?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis goes on for a while as they bring up stuff like the miners how they were crushed. In the end they agree 3% is not enough and something needs to be done, that they’ll be voting against accepting with the union but that to them strike action is just beyond the pale. I get the feeling that although it was the only one there making this case it is probably more representative of nurses in general.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e* Report from Bristol\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI took part in a UNISON union drop-in for the pay campaign. The problem was that the union only emailed and texted individual members and that the drop-in took place in a pretty remote tent structure – many of the colleagues I asked didn’t know where it actually was. So it wasn’t really a surprise that only a dozen or so people turned up, out of 8,000 plus hospital workers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI asked the branch secretary if the joint union committee, which comprises the half a dozen unions recognised on site, could have a joint rally, in order to attract more attention, also from workers who are not members of any union. He said that the unions decided to have separate actions, also because they have different pay demands. He added that the RCN action mobilised less than ten people. After the first two weeks of campaign only about 10 to 15% of UNISON members were said to have returned a vote, which is pretty bad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the meantime the trust management reacts to pressure from below and announced that they have over 30 new nurses starting in September and that they will hire a large number of HCAs in autumn. They asked each ward manager to spread the word, in order to re-assure burnt-out workers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e* What’s the NHS Pay Review?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe can agree that the pay increase that has been mandated is an insult to workers. But it’s helpful to understand the basis and background of the NHS pay review in order to consider how best to respond to it and struggle for a better deal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe current pay increase isn’t a ‘pay offer’ and workers and unions are not part of ‘wage negotiations’. So this is a different situation to those for example in some private sector wage struggles we may be comparing this to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe NHS Pay Review Body (NHSPRB) writes an annual report (you can see them here: https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/nhs-pay-review-body). It is responsible for recommending pay increases for workers under Agenda for Change pay scales, and the last recommendations were made in 2018 to cover the next 3 years so are up for review this year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn doing this the NHSPRB takes evidence and recommendations from stakeholders, both government and the unions as well as other organisations including this year campaign group Nurses United. This year, the government’s recommendation was a 1% pay rise. Other recommendations varied, e.g. Unison asked for £2,000 on every pay point, the RCN requested 12.5% for all Agenda for Change staff, and UNITE asked for the higher of £3,000 or 15%. Nurses United also requested 15%.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe NHSPRB then reviews all the evidence, including what the government has said about funding and the financial situation, the labour market situation, vacancies, staff moral and retention, and this year the impact of Covid. On the basis of this they make a recommendation taking all of these things into account, and are recommending a 3% pay increase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo the unions are now starting to consult on this pay increase, but this is not about whether we accept the pay increase, which is being imposed on us rather than offered, but whether we want to challenge it. Most unions are recommending industrial action, but there seems to be a degree of inertia and a lack of action on the ground in terms of organising to make that happen. They are initially launching ‘indicative ballots’ before deciding whether to seek a vote for strike action. Indicative ballots are not a legal requirement. If the unions did then move to vote for industrial action, this can take place legally if 40% of balloted workers vote in favour of it and at least half of the membership votes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis process and how it differs from other pay struggles raises some questions such as:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-What difference does having the mediation of the NHSPRB have on the relations between the employer and the workers/unions?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-Although pay review bodies arose out of historical conflicts (such as the wage disputes and strikes of the early 1980s), they now report annually and the proposed increases happen as a routine rather than resulting from workers’ struggle. Has this disconnected and disempowered workers from the sense that we need to struggle for pay and conditions?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-Does the lumping together of a wide range of professional groups and unions in this way dilute their power?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e-Has the pandemic influenced NHS workers’ sense of struggle, or their power to do so? Can our response to the pay review be different this year?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e* Global supply-crisis hits the NHS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe health sector is a global entity, even if it’s called ‘National Health Service. Our PPE all came from China and currently there is a global shortage of tube for blood transfusion. We are also connected directly to workers in many other sectors, e.g. at the moment there are no flu jabs available due to labour shortage in the transport sector. In our hospital we had no wet wipes for weeks – which makes work really hard!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe could see all this just as nuisances and problems. Or we could see that if we combine our strength with other workers, we could improve our own situation. People only notice the vital work of, for example, truck drivers when the pubs run out of beer, McDonalds out of milk-shakes or hospitals out of medical supply. Workers, whether in care or other sectors have been told for too long that they have to accept low wages, because they are portrayed as being replaceable. At the moment we see that this is not the case!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe also see many struggles of health workers in regions such as India, Philippines, Poland or Nigeria – and many of our colleagues in hospitals and community health centres come from these places! Again, we can see this connection as a problem: ‘Management can replace us with migrant nurses any time!’ Or as a potential: ’Thanks to our colleagues who came from abroad we can learn more about experiences of struggle for better conditions!’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e* Strikes at the two biggest hospitals in Berlin\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnd of August the trade union Verdi has called nursing staff at the state-owned hospital groups Charité and Vivantes out on a three-day warning strike. It’s mainly about staffing-levels, but also about equal pay within the hospital, as many workers are outsourced to subsidiary companies. Currently, the 2,500 employees at these subsidiaries receive several hundred euros less than those doing the same work at Vivantes. The response among workers at all eight Vivantes hospitals and the three Charité campuses to the partial strike has been solid. Supporters constructed solidarity camps outside of the hospitals, organising workshops, cultural events and public actions. The strike has an impact, according to the Berliner Tagesspiegel, Charité has already cancelled 2,000 appointments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eManagement at the two hospital groups have reacted with ruthless arrogance towards the strikers’ concerns. Vivantes said it would not accept a collective agreement because the nationwide shortage of skilled workers means a reduction in nurses’ workload would force the company to cut 360 to 750 beds. Consequently, the company would have to dismiss doctors and other non-nursing staff. “The result would be a reduction of 870 to 1,300 jobs and an additional deficit of 25 to 45 million euros,” management claimed. This is clear blackmail! Vivantes blames nursing staff for the reduction of beds and jobs because they refuse to be paid peanuts for too stressful work. Workers cannot rely on the union, though. During the last dispute workers from the subsidiary companies were sold out. In the meantime management at other hospitals throw money at the problem: rather than agreeing to better staffing levels they pay up to 50 Euros an hour for nurses who take on additional shifts, such as in the vaccination project.\u003cbr /\u003e\nOn 6th of September 98% of union members at the two hospitals voted in favour of an indefinite strike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e* Coming up: Discussion with health workers in New Zealand\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHealth workers in New Zealand have engaged in a series of strikes recently, midwives refused to attend elective c-sections, which is quite a step to take!

The various trade unions are slowly starting to inform their members about the consultation – if you are a member, please vote to reject the 3% government pay ‘increase’ decision. Inflation is expected to rise to up to 4% – we might be in for another real wage cut. Here are a few things that we should bear in mind over the coming weeks – until the union consultation closes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e* As health workers we are between a rock and a hard place. The government won’t budge and improve the 3% pay ‘increase’. It will need a lot of pressure to get a better wage. The unions will have to do something to build this pressure, but they are not used to it. They are used to petitioning, symbolic protests, perhaps a demonstration. They are afraid of taking industrial action on a larger scale, last but not least because it might cost them money. At the same time, they have promised members a lot, so they have to show that they are doing something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"wordads-ad-wrapper\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"atatags-26942-894921\" data-adtags-width=\"740\"\u003e* The most likely outcome of this pay dispute is that the unions don’t manage to get enough people to vote in favour of industrial action. This might actually be the best outcome for the union headquarters, as they could say: “We wanted to mobilise our members, but they decided not to pursue the struggle”. They would not have to do much, but would not lose face. According to the law, there has to be one official industrial ballot to take action – as if that wasn’t enough of a hurdle, the unions add two more ballots: the current ‘consultation’ and then an ‘indicative ballot’. It is hard to encourage people to vote three times whether or not to do something!\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e* The question is also whether the pay question is enough of a motivating issue. Any percentage increase will widen the already stark wage gaps between the different bands. For example, with the current 3% increase that the government wants to give us, a worker on Band 2 will get only about £580 more per year, while a Band 6 will get £1,130 and a Band 9 over £3,000 extra. We have to bring other issues to the table – first of all staffing levels and work stress. Both government and union headquarters will say that this is not possible because this is a ‘pay dispute’ – but if many of us agree that not only pay, but also work stress is a major issue, they can’t stop us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e* We will see a few information stalls and activities by the unions in the coming weeks. Up to now they are timid, on the fringes of the hospitals, e.g. handing out free coffee in the car park. If we want to get more of our fellow colleagues involved we have to bring this dispute into the centre. Let’s call for general meetings of all groups of workers during break-times.

Although the meeting was announced as an ‘activist’ meeting, it was mainly a panel of paid organisers who talked. They informed us about Unison’s general position on the pay dispute. They claimed that it was ‘campaigning’ that moved the government to increase the offer from 1% to 3%. This is questionable, but this version of events pleases both sides: the government can say that they ‘improved’, and the union headquarters can say that they’ve already ‘achieved’ something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was no real contribution from different union branches, no exchange of ideas about what to do. It was mainly the paid officials telling people what kind of material, arguments and conversation strategies there are in order to convince members to vote. One of the main questions was not discussed: what kind of industrial actions are there apart from an all-out strike? For many colleagues it seems that the only option is to either accept the offer or to go on strike. But a strike is quite a hurdle – there are concerns about the patients, about losing pay. We have to discuss other forms of industrial action which seem easier to take, as a first step. Work-to-rule, for example, where you only perform tasks that are in your job description. Or a collective refusal to work bank shifts. We might need a full-on strike, where only the most essential tasks are performed in order not to risk patients’ lives – but we have to build up to that by trusting each others and our creative abilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"wordads-ad-wrapper\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"atatags-26942-176362\" data-adtags-width=\"740\"\u003e*\u003cstrong\u003e Brief workplace report from a mental health worker, north of England\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI work in a community mental health team in the north of England. This is a brief report of our experiences over the pandemic and some initial thoughts about how it relates to the pay deal. Like everyone in health and social care, we’ve had a pretty tough 18 months. The pandemic came on the back of a recent change in our team structures, and we were already struggling with staff shortages and constant rounds of not-that-successful recruitment. Like everyone, we had to adapt quickly to the lockdown, moving to remote working, and we were suddenly faced with even more pressure on staff due to team members being redeployed onto the wards and staff shielding. We had the weird experience of GP referrals going down in the full lockdown, but with more people coming to us in crisis, and we all had to change how we worked and found ourselves being even more reactive and fire-fighting than usual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs things have opened up we’ve started to do more face-to-face working, and starting to see each other and our patients in real life has made work feel slightly pleasant and less surreal. But the staff shortages have actually got worse. I don’t know how many ‘sorry to see you go’ cards I’ve signed in the last few months and we’ve struggled to recruit even into quite senior posts. Care co-ordinators have got caseloads of really unwell patients of 40+ and it’s hard to feel like you’re doing your job properly. We’ve had a load more people off with Covid recently even though vaccinated and others off for mental health reasons, and it’s hard not to feel cross about ‘freedom day’ when we’re still feeling the impact quite severely, even if things haven’t gone as badly as we feared they might.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s been no talk at all in my team about the pay increases, and it feels a bit hard to raise as one of the more senior members of the team. I’m sure there’s a few reasons for this: the lack of communication from our unions, the fact we’re split between different professional groups and unions, and the focus of our concerns and stress being about workload and staffing rather than pay and just being completely and utterly exhausted. There’s also the fact that we’re still mostly working remotely, and even aside from that, as a community-based team, we don’t spend that much time together and don’t really have a staff room. I also think we can easily buy in to the ‘hero’ or ‘angel’ culture that’s been encouraged in the pandemic. As well, the fact that our team’s strong identity and sometimes quite an ‘in-group’ mentality means that we have a culture of ‘just getting on with things’, or blaming problems on other teams and colleagues, rather than thinking more widely about politics, services structures and organisation. I’d be pleased to hear from others about the steps that can be taken to overcome this and shift the culture from pay being a bit of a taboo, to being something that’s important to talk and join in struggle about.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e* Brief report on resources, capacity and commissioning problems for community mental health workers, South East England, Summer 2021\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt feels like workers are having to accept being under-resourced as an ordinary part of the job. The team I’m with has lost a third of its staff in three years, through cuts and workers transferring out or moving on. Community mental health services in England are funded by the NHS and local authorities/councils. A freeze on recruitment just now means council employed workers who’ve left during the last year aren’t being replaced. There’s a promise of some health funding coming to match the gaps, but these things take time. When workers leave it can be months before their posts are covered, even temporarily. In the meantime, work needs picking up. At present, workers can be responsible for up to thirty peoples’ care at one time. On service they should average about half this amount to allow for the kind of flexibility needed for purposeful, responsive mental health outreach. It’s a service set up to work with patients whose needs tend to go unmet in more generic teams, but with less capacity the kinds of care/treatments on offer end up being reduced or restricted, becoming less meaningful. It’s upsetting. Expectations from commissioners and other providers haven’t really shifted with the reduced capacity, so workers are being stretched to meet service agreements they can’t honour with the resources they have.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"wordads-ad-wrapper\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"atatags-26942-574030\" data-adtags-width=\"740\"\u003eCommissioning groups monitor the services planned and purchased with NHS funds to check they’re on track and doing what they’re supposed to. This isn’t novel to the pandemic but with more remote/online working this last year, it feels like there’s also been more day-to-day monitoring of how the work gets done. It’s become commonplace to have commissioners copied into emails and involved in more routine aspects of the work, including decisions about direct patient care. This feels like a new development from previous contract-review processes in that there’s now a kind of real time performance monitoring for partner/customer satisfaction. Other services and care providers are encouraged to report and appeal to commissioners’ powers to intervene if they’re dissatisfied with how the team is working. Whilst this probably helps with things like accountability, and maybe even draws attention to the resource gaps, it more often undermines trust and dials up antagonisms between different groups of workers. It takes effort and care to recognise these problems and attend to them in ways that keep us working together.\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*\u003cstrong\u003e Successful campaign by paramedic students in Scotland\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe don’t know much about this campaign, but it seems relevant when discussing what collective action can achieve. From the press release: “Today represents a monumental win for student paramedics across Scotland, with our campaign achieveing its goal of winning a bursary equal to that of nurses and midwives. The difference this will make to the lives of hundreds is gigantic. The pressures of food poverty, worrying about rent and mental health will all be eased. This bursary was won because student paramedics came together to fight against an obvious injustice. Our reports over the past year have shown the financial and mental strain completing this course without a bursary takes.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.paystudentparamedics.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.paystudentparamedics.org\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e*\u003cstrong\u003e A book to read: “The Next Shift – The Fall of Industry and the Rise of Health Care in Rust Belt America”, by Gabriel Winant\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674238091\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674238091\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis book on changes in the working class in the USA seems interesting and insightful. Pittsburgh was once synonymous with steel. But today most of its mills are gone. Like so many places across the United States, a city that was a centre of blue-collar manufacturing is now dominated by the service economy—particularly healthcare, which employs more Americans than any other industry. Gabriel Winant takes us inside the Rust Belt to show how America’s cities have weathered new economic realities. In Pittsburgh’s neighbourhoods, he finds that a new working class has emerged in the wake of deindustrialization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs steelworkers and their families grew older, they required more healthcare. Even as the industrial economy contracted sharply, the care economy thrived. Hospitals and nursing homes went on hiring sprees. But many care jobs bear little resemblance to the manufacturing work the city lost. Unlike their blue-collar predecessors, home health aides and hospital staff work unpredictable hours for low pay. And the new working class disproportionately comprises women and people of colour.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eToday healthcare workers are on the front lines of our most pressing crises, yet we have been slow to appreciate that they are the face of our twenty-first-century workforce. The Next Shift offers unique insights into how we got here and what could happen next. If health care employees, along with other essential workers, can translate the increasing recognition of their economic value into political power, they may become a major force in the twenty-first century.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"wordads-ad-wrapper\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"atatags-26942-570530\" data-adtags-width=\"740\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e* International news\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLast week there we saw many struggles of health workers all over the globe. Nurses in the Philippines threatened strike action after not having been paid their Covid bonus, while the health minister is embroiled in corruption charges (sounds familiar?!). Nurses are still on strike after several months at St.Vincent hospital in Massachusetts, USA. In France, health workers gear up for a national strike against compulsory vaccination decreed by the government. In New Zealand midwives are on strike and they are on strike for real: they cancelled elective c-sections! In Berlin, Germany, health workers at two major hospitals are getting organised for strike next week, supporters set up a ‘solidarity camp’ with entertainment, workshops and other activities. In Northern Ireland mental health nurses went on a ‘safety strike’, after an increase of attacks and lack of staff. There were also strikes of nurses in, amongst others, Peru, Kenya and India.
