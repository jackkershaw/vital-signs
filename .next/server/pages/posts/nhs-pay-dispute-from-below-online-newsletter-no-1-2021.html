2021</h1></div></div></div></div><div class="max-w-2xl mx-auto"><div class="post-body_content__ye_eq"><p>* The various trade unions in the NHS started sending emails to their members to ask them whether to accept or reject the 3% pay offer from the government and whether to take industrial action or not. These consultations end at different times: RCN on the 13th of September; UNISON on the 10th of September; GMB on the 17th of September, Unite on the 24th of September etc.</p>
<p>* Sending out emails to individual members is not enough. Sitting alone at home, asked to vote ‘yes or no’, doesn’t make us feel strong. It also doesn’t reach our co-workers who are not union members – who are the majority. We need assemblies and rallies of all hospital or community ward workers, where we can see each other, give each other courage, discuss what to do. If the unions are not calling for such joint assemblies, we have to organise them ourselves.</p>
<p>* We have to talk about the different kind of problems we have at work and that we want to deal with. Pay is one issue amongst others. The daily stress due to lack of staff is a big one! They push more and more work on to us, from increased documentation to extra patients. This is frustrating for us and the patients, as well.</p>
<p>* We need to discuss how we can put pressure on management and the government. There are all kind of ways to organise a strike in hospitals without endangering patients’ lives. There are various actions that can put pressure on politicians, from occupying public administration to blocking roads. Petitions alone won’t impress them.</p>
<p>* We need independent channels to inform each other what is happening in different trusts across the country. This online newsletter is only one of many ways how we can exchange experiences about the pay campaign, about what the various unions are doing and what not, about what kind of actions we could all take together in order to change things. Feel free to send this newsletters to colleagues and friends and to send your own thoughts and observations.</p>
<p><strong>* Senior health care assistant, maternity unit, Bradford</strong></p>
<p>Working during Covid was demanding, we had to improvise a lot due to staff shortage. When the government then announced the 1% pay offer people were pretty demoralised, many skilled midwives leave the field. They leave because usually the unions don’t promote going on strike. I have been working here 30 years and we never went on strike. I am not in the union anymore, I was a shop-steward, but I felt the union was more with management than with the workers. Now with the RCN things have improved a bit, but things are still difficult.</p>
<p>My colleagues talk about the pay offer a lot and would be up for industrial actions, but they worry about the consequences. As a form of industrial action you could refuse to fill out certain paper-work while still providing care, but then they tell us that legally you are obliged to do the documentation. It’s hard, we are not making sausages, we care for people. On maternity wards especially it is difficult to do just ‘minimum service’. Workers here are stressed out. Management currently offers a 40% bonus if midwives take up bank shifts, but they don’t do it, because they are over-worked, but also because they feel under-valued and just don’t want to work extra-shifts. We would need an action all over the trust.</p>
<p><strong>* Collective sick-out at (private) Helios hospital in Germany – In reaction to systematic understaffing</strong></p>
<p>Since the beginning of June, management has allowed the admission of more and more patients to the hospital. Patients spent hours sitting in corridors, waiting for beds to become available. The nurse per patient ratio reached from 1:20 to peaks of 1:30. Despite an increase of sickness-related absence of nurses and other health workers, management refused to cap the numbers of admitted patients. Apprentices and support staff had to take over tasks they had not been trained for, such as supervising monitors with patients’ vital signals.</p>
<p>End of July the situation escalated and a whole ward shift called in sick for three consecutive days. Patients had to be relocated to ICU and A&amp;E. Only that moved management to officially declare that the hospital had reached its capacity limit. Surgeries had to be postponed. Management was aware that this was the result of a collective action, and workers celebrated this, even in those departments that had to deal with the relocated patients.</p>
<p>For the time being management has limited the amount of patients per ward, e.g. in cardiology there are currently 25 instead of 53 beds. Management has threatened individual workers with job transferals, but they have to acknowledge that the problem is not going away and that they have to do something about staffing levels. Without the workers, no patients and no money…</p>
<p><strong>* Health worker, Southmead hospital, Bristol</strong></p>
<p>Staffing levels are a major problem. Often you end up having four nurses and three HCAs looking after 33 patients who often actually require 1:1. This is hard as it is, but then the housekeeper is off and they can’t get a bank replacement. We are then expected to do that work on top of our work load. People are rushed into jobs without the proper training, because they don’t have enough staff to do the supernumerary shifts.</p>
<p>Management knows about the problem. For July and August they offer bonus payments for anyone who takes up extra bank shifts. For example, Band 2 are paid £21.05 per hour, Band 5 are paid £31.44. Regarding the pay campaign we had a protest here in Bristol organised by the NHS15 campaign, but most unions were not present, also only very few health workers. The campaign is not visible in the hospital.</p>
<p><strong>* NHS social worker, south east England</strong></p>
<p><em>How do you feel about the fair pay for NHS workers campaigns?</em></p>
<p>There are other issues I care more about but I’m broadly supportive of all industrial organising within the NHS.</p>
<p><em>What do think could help more [social] workers feel able to get involved and show support?</em></p>
<p>Appealing for more solidarity across the whole workforce. Finding shared areas of concern with social workers and offering reciprocity. Meeting with social work union representatives to formally invite them to get involved and to discuss how this might happen in practical terms. Framing this as a struggle for social justice more widely i.e. by showing the impact of unfair pay on the most precarious members of the NHS workforce &amp; emphasising how this campaign is also protecting the interests of patients who depend on publicly funded healthcare.</p>
<p><em>Are there any changes you’d love to see in your workplace that aren’t pay related?</em></p>
<p>Changes to the terms of employment may help to make the workplace more privately bearable in the short term but in my opinion the bigger problem is the alienation from their own labour that so many NHS workers and their patients have come to feel is normal. The changes that I would like to see happening would be seeking to create and protect the possibility for non-alienated care labour within the NHS.</p>
<p><em>Could you spell the ‘alienation’ or ‘non-alienated labour’ out a bit more?</em></p>
<p>By alienated labour, I’m talking about what can happen when healthcare work is organised so much around the strategic priorities of NHS England that nothing else seems to matter. One of the consequences of this for frontline workers is that they can easily be made to feel that their labour only has value insofar as it is helping to smooth the way for agendas that have nothing to do with them. The alienation comes from the corresponding (unspoken) requirement that they should not care so much about what they are doing because this makes it more difficult for them to put the interests of their organisation first. This means that workers are withdrawing their affective investments in their own labour at the point that they don’t coincide with the interests of NHS England.</p>
<p>By non-alienated labour, I mean the kind of healthcare labour that doesn’t leave you feeling isolated and overwhelmed with the consequences of having a stake in it. For example, where the realities of healthcare in the NHS are not made into the private concern of individual workers, where workers are not required to do things that don’t make sense to them and where the task of organising healthcare labour is not left to those who won’t be directly involved in doing the work themselves.</p>
<p><strong>* Health workers struggles around the world</strong></p>
<p>During the last two weeks nurses went on strike in Kinshasa and Harare; nurses protested against arbitrary redundancies in Caracas and Hyderabad; hospital workers called for strike in Marseille and Lyon to protest against the government’s Covid laws; in Guatemala health workers joined the general strike; Covid support workers went on strike in Pakistan due to unpaid wages; in Germany and on the Bahamas nurses went on a collective sick-out; and in the USA and New Zealand workers have been on strike at various hospitals and nursing homes…</p>
<p>…so let’s not let them make us believe that health workers cannot take industrial action! For these news and many more follow us on Twitter: healthworkersu1</p>

various trade unions in the NHS started sending emails to their members to ask them whether to accept or reject the 3% pay offer from the government and whether to take industrial action or not. These consultations end at different times: RCN on the 13th of September; UNISON on the 10th of September; GMB on the 17th of September, Unite on the 24th of September etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e* Sending out emails to individual members is not enough. Sitting alone at home, asked to vote ‘yes or no’, doesn’t make us feel strong. It also doesn’t reach our co-workers who are not union members – who are the majority. We need assemblies and rallies of all hospital or community ward workers, where we can see each other, give each other courage, discuss what to do. If the unions are not calling for such joint assemblies, we have to organise them ourselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e* We have to talk about the different kind of problems we have at work and that we want to deal with. Pay is one issue amongst others. The daily stress due to lack of staff is a big one! They push more and more work on to us, from increased documentation to extra patients. This is frustrating for us and the patients, as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e* We need to discuss how we can put pressure on management and the government. There are all kind of ways to organise a strike in hospitals without endangering patients’ lives. There are various actions that can put pressure on politicians, from occupying public administration to blocking roads. Petitions alone won’t impress them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e* We need independent channels to inform each other what is happening in different trusts across the country. This online newsletter is only one of many ways how we can exchange experiences about the pay campaign, about what the various unions are doing and what not, about what kind of actions we could all take together in order to change things. Feel free to send this newsletters to colleagues and friends and to send your own thoughts and observations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e* Senior health care assistant, maternity unit, Bradford\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorking during Covid was demanding, we had to improvise a lot due to staff shortage. When the government then announced the 1% pay offer people were pretty demoralised, many skilled midwives leave the field. They leave because usually the unions don’t promote going on strike. I have been working here 30 years and we never went on strike. I am not in the union anymore, I was a shop-steward, but I felt the union was more with management than with the workers. Now with the RCN things have improved a bit, but things are still difficult.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy colleagues talk about the pay offer a lot and would be up for industrial actions, but they worry about the consequences. As a form of industrial action you could refuse to fill out certain paper-work while still providing care, but then they tell us that legally you are obliged to do the documentation. It’s hard, we are not making sausages, we care for people. On maternity wards especially it is difficult to do just ‘minimum service’. Workers here are stressed out. Management currently offers a 40% bonus if midwives take up bank shifts, but they don’t do it, because they are over-worked, but also because they feel under-valued and just don’t want to work extra-shifts. We would need an action all over the trust.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e* Collective sick-out at (private) Helios hospital in Germany – In reaction to systematic understaffing\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince the beginning of June, management has allowed the admission of more and more patients to the hospital. Patients spent hours sitting in corridors, waiting for beds to become available. The nurse per patient ratio reached from 1:20 to peaks of 1:30. Despite an increase of sickness-related absence of nurses and other health workers, management refused to cap the numbers of admitted patients. Apprentices and support staff had to take over tasks they had not been trained for, such as supervising monitors with patients’ vital signals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnd of July the situation escalated and a whole ward shift called in sick for three consecutive days. Patients had to be relocated to ICU and A\u0026amp;E. Only that moved management to officially declare that the hospital had reached its capacity limit. Surgeries had to be postponed. Management was aware that this was the result of a collective action, and workers celebrated this, even in those departments that had to deal with the relocated patients.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the time being management has limited the amount of patients per ward, e.g. in cardiology there are currently 25 instead of 53 beds. Management has threatened individual workers with job transferals, but they have to acknowledge that the problem is not going away and that they have to do something about staffing levels. Without the workers, no patients and no money…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e* Health worker, Southmead hospital, Bristol\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStaffing levels are a major problem. Often you end up having four nurses and three HCAs looking after 33 patients who often actually require 1:1. This is hard as it is, but then the housekeeper is off and they can’t get a bank replacement. We are then expected to do that work on top of our work load. People are rushed into jobs without the proper training, because they don’t have enough staff to do the supernumerary shifts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eManagement knows about the problem. For July and August they offer bonus payments for anyone who takes up extra bank shifts. For example, Band 2 are paid £21.05 per hour, Band 5 are paid £31.44. Regarding the pay campaign we had a protest here in Bristol organised by the NHS15 campaign, but most unions were not present, also only very few health workers. The campaign is not visible in the hospital.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e* NHS social worker, south east England\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eHow do you feel about the fair pay for NHS workers campaigns?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are other issues I care more about but I’m broadly supportive of all industrial organising within the NHS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat do think could help more [social] workers feel able to get involved and show support?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAppealing for more solidarity across the whole workforce. Finding shared areas of concern with social workers and offering reciprocity. Meeting with social work union representatives to formally invite them to get involved and to discuss how this might happen in practical terms. Framing this as a struggle for social justice more widely i.e. by showing the impact of unfair pay on the most precarious members of the NHS workforce \u0026amp; emphasising how this campaign is also protecting the interests of patients who depend on publicly funded healthcare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eAre there any changes you’d love to see in your workplace that aren’t pay related?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChanges to the terms of employment may help to make the workplace more privately bearable in the short term but in my opinion the bigger problem is the alienation from their own labour that so many NHS workers and their patients have come to feel is normal. The changes that I would like to see happening would be seeking to create and protect the possibility for non-alienated care labour within the NHS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eCould you spell the ‘alienation’ or ‘non-alienated labour’ out a bit more?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy alienated labour, I’m talking about what can happen when healthcare work is organised so much around the strategic priorities of NHS England that nothing else seems to matter. One of the consequences of this for frontline workers is that they can easily be made to feel that their labour only has value insofar as it is helping to smooth the way for agendas that have nothing to do with them. The alienation comes from the corresponding (unspoken) requirement that they should not care so much about what they are doing because this makes it more difficult for them to put the interests of their organisation first. This means that workers are withdrawing their affective investments in their own labour at the point that they don’t coincide with the interests of NHS England.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy non-alienated labour, I mean the kind of healthcare labour that doesn’t leave you feeling isolated and overwhelmed with the consequences of having a stake in it. For example, where the realities of healthcare in the NHS are not made into the private concern of individual workers, where workers are not required to do things that don’t make sense to them and where the task of organising healthcare labour is not left to those who won’t be directly involved in doing the work themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e* Health workers struggles around the world\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring the last two weeks nurses went on strike in Kinshasa and Harare; nurses protested against arbitrary redundancies in Caracas and Hyderabad; hospital workers called for strike in Marseille and Lyon to protest against the government’s Covid laws; in Guatemala health workers joined the general strike; Covid support workers went on strike in Pakistan due to unpaid wages; in Germany and on the Bahamas nurses went on a collective sick-out; and in the USA and New Zealand workers have been on strike at various hospitals and nursing homes…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e…so let’s not let them make us believe that health workers cannot take industrial action!

These may not have gained as much attention as the big national strikes, but it is important to look at them to analyse what is at stake here and whether there is anything that we can learn from them. What is interesting about the strikes that have been happening in the last year or so is that they mostly involve workers in lower bands that were broadly left of the big national disputes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, Band 2 is a whole penny more than minimum wage per hour. You’ve got co-workers who have been working for the NHS for 30 years who are suddenly being paid the bare minimum that the NHS can get away with. We haven’t seen much in the way of a response yet, but when we do, we need to look at the struggles that have happened in the NHS recently, the strengths as well as the weaknesses to work out a strategy to win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHCA re-banding\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost of the smaller strikes that we’ve seen recently involve HCAs pushing for re-banding to Band 3 with backpay to cover work that they were doing before these disputes. Mostly covered by Unison, these disputes have taken the tactic of short strikes and urging individual trusts to match what other trusts around the country have already done. In NBT for instance, HCAs were re-banded and awarded the lump sum backpay in January 2023 without having to go on strike, after a short campaign. Where trusts are holding out, we are seeing bitter disputes. Wirrall has seen the longest strike in NHS history, with Band 2 HCAs going on strike for 23 days at the beginning of the year, following 43 days in the second half of 2023. The Trust that manages the hospital have point blank refused to follow the trend of the rest of the NHS and NHS England have not stepped in to resolve the dispute. In fact, the national body managing NHS employers has advised that keeping HCAs (or Clinical Support Workers, as they’re called up there) on Band 2 is in line with the Agenda for Change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s difficult to work out why Wirral are so reluctant to follow suit with the majority of Trusts, especially when the campaign that led to these strikes took place in three other trusts that have all settled with the union. What this does show, though, is that despite the perception that the NHS is a massive bureaucratic entity where the government has the final say, there is still an immediate class struggle to be had at the level of individual trusts with local bosses. This creates opportunities, where workers in one Trust can set terms for the rest of the NHS. This looks like it’s what happened with UNISON’s campaign to re-band HCAs, where workers pushed both the Trust and the union to implement the change, and there was a chain reaction from there. Beyond the initial campaign though, the push has been entirely managed by Unison through official channels and it doesn’t look like there have been many links made between workers at different trusts. We need to develop these connections if we are going to win in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of confronting the problem of understaffing seriously, what tends to be happening is that workers in lower paid positions are now just doing work that used to be done by higher band workers. We see it in HCAs doing nurses’ work, nurses doing doctors’ work etc. As the NHS strains at the seams, instead of resolving the real issues of understaffing and work intensification, NHS leaders insist that workers in various roles should just work more, selling it as \u0026#8216;career opportunities\u0026#8217;. However, that will never translate to increased pay without a fight.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePay enhancements and bonuses\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePay enhancements being offered unevenly is another issue that we have seen a number of local strikes over in the past year. The most interesting one was the Maternity Care Assistant strike at Southmead that also included receptionists and housekeepers. The Trust was offering considerable pay enhancements to midwives but refusing to extend the same bonus offers to the lower paid workers, using the argument that they were not “first class staff” and could be easily replaced. The workers who went on strike made the argument that the work of the supposedly first class staff could not happen without the cooperation of the lower paid staff. Although the strike was well organised within the team, it doesn’t seem as though they were able to make much contact with other workers across the trust who were also not offered the pay enhancements, which could have bolstered the strike and opened up other opportunities for a stronger strike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSelective awarding of bonuses has also caused other strikes across the NHS. Cleaners at a hospital in Dudley were excluded from the Covid related bonus pay because they were employed by Mitie, instead of directly by the NHS. There was a similar strike in South London, where workers were on contracts with no sick pay and didn’t receive any of the Covid bonuses despite working like the rest of us through the pandemic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn these cases, what’s clear is how divisions in the workforce are used by managers, trust leaders, etc. to carve up our potential unity and our capacity to help each other in our struggles. A lot of these strikes won small concessions, but imagine how much more powerful they could have been if they were coordinated with each other. The unions don’t seem to have much interest in doing this, they like to keep everything as separate as possible. It’s up to us to make the connections, create forums for discussions about strategy and tactics like where we hold picket lines and which other workers we need to talk to. The work we do doesn’t happen without the complex cooperation of workers with different skills and knowledge. Our struggles need to reflect this and use it as our strength with nurses and doctors standing alongside cleaners and housekeepers and vice versa. Without this, they’ll keep beating us back one at a time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJunior Doctors\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Junior Doctors’ dispute is the only national one still going on from the wave of pay campaigns a couple of years ago. Despite the more radical demand of pay restoration (35%) to 2010 levels, there hasn’t seemed to be much movement. The junior doctors were left isolated after various other groups of workers were sold sell-out deals. During the most recent strikes in February, the BMA union even told workers where they could and couldn’t have pickets, meaning there wasn’t any physical presence of the strike in Bristol.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe junior doctor strike still has a direct impact on the work in the hospital. For example, on a strike day often only half of the theatres for elective orthopaedic surgeries are in operation, because surgeons are sent to work on wards or in A\u0026amp;E. But this impact alone does not create bonds between workers, in this case between scrub nurses, health care support workers in theatres and striking junior doctors. The striking workers are not visible to other workers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere have been issues with this strike from the start, with a lot of the messaging being focused around how junior doctors are worth so much more than other types of workers. This is a losing strategy, both for the particular dispute and for the working class more broadly. It’s our cooperation that gives us strength, and workers with more technical knowledge and positions such as junior doctors need to use their positions to bolster the struggles of other sections of the class, after all how could they do their jobs without an ary of support workers. The challenge will be for the junior doctors to open up discussions with other workers in hospitals, to work out where we can find common issues for struggle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUnderstaffing\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly one strike has happened directly in response to the issue of understaffing. Despite understaffing being the massive elephant in the room in every dispute, only one strike in August 23 demanded a solution to the staffing crisis. Over 2,500 workers across 4 trusts in London went on strike, across various roles from nurses to pathologists to cleaners. Unfortunately this is an isolated case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAny conversation with co-workers gives the impression that understaffing is the main concern for most of us in the NHS, and it is an issue that creates a natural unity across all bands and job roles. If we are going to push for a health service that is fit for purpose, we need to be having discussions in every hospital with workers in different jobs, bands and unions to plan our struggles, and we need to learn from the limitations of the strikes over the past few years. Bosses have used the divisions that already exist to carve up our strikes and take away their bite. Unions have caved under pressure, offering sell-out deal after sell-out deal, and there hasn’t been an effective counter-balance which could hold everything together. Labour don’t look like they’ll be much better than the Tories when they’re in government. We need to use our position of strength as essential workers to put forward a plan for the NHS and enforce it through collective action, not just stick to individual moaning about how bad things are!\u003c/p\u003e\n"}},{"node":{"title":"Issue no.1 – Re-banding or banding together?","excerpt":"\u003cp\u003eIf we don’t stick together and stand up for ourselves against stress and low wages, the bitching will start sooner or later.

At the same time we are confronted with the results of decisions that affect us, but that we have little control over. The wards, theatres, hospital kitchens, pharmacies, porter lodges and store rooms would not run if we hadn’t learnt to juggle with our co-workers. It sometimes really is like a circus. In order to juggle together you have to trust each other, have each other\u0026#8217;s back, be pals. But it is hard to be close and friendly under stress. If we don’t stick together and stand up for ourselves against stress and low wages, the bitching will start sooner or later. We will look for the ones who supposedly “don’t pull their weight”. We feel like competitors, rather than fellow jugglers. In the end the patients will suffer, too, because care workers who don’t work together cannot take good care. That’s why it is important to form communities of friendliness and resistance. Resistance against a system that expects everything from us, but gives us little resources and control over our lives.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eThe big nurses’ strikes in 2023 were important. They pushed the government to pay us more. But they often didn’t manage to create that community of friendliness and resistance, because we were not in control of the strike either. It was managed far away in some trade union offices. That’s why it is important for us to look also at smaller actions and struggles, some open, some hidden. We can learn a lot from each other. Let’s take the maternity care assistants at Southmead as an example. In October 2023 they went on several days of strike. They were not happy that special incentives for overtime were only paid to registered staff. It was so beautiful to see them all together. But they remained alone. How many colleagues in the Brunel building knew about the strike, how many came over in support? And what happened with the dispute, how do our MCA colleagues feel about the strike, what are their lessons for the future? We don’t know, because we don’t have an independent forum to talk about these things. This series is a little step towards the creation of such a forum.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eBelow you can find the write-up of a conversation between two health care assistants. The first HCA, Jack, is working in Bristol, the other, Jones, somewhere around London. They chat about surviving at work and the struggle to survive. The dispute around the question if HCAs should be paid Band 2 or Band 3 is a widespread one. In 2023/24 a long strike of HCAs took place in Liverpool around the same issue and currently HCAs in Plymouth and Leicester are protesting. It is a complicated issue. Don’t we all need and deserve more money? What is more complicated, changing a wet bed sheet safely under a patient with bed sores (Band 2) or checking their glucose level (Band 3)? What is a greater and riskier responsibility, hoisting a poorly obese patient out of bed or taking their blood pressure? In our hospitals most of the permanent HCAs were paid a back payment for Band 3 tasks, while the Bank HCAs were excluded. Let’s not be divided over these issues – whether HCA or domestic, whether substantial or Bank, we all work our socks off. If you and your colleagues find ways to create solidarity and resistance, write to us.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJack:\u003c/strong\u003e In our Trust the qualification of an HCA is very arbitrary. They used to say that even if you have some care experience, if you don\u0026#8217;t have a care certificate they encourage you to go on an apprenticeship for Band 2, which is the lowest paid and lowest skilled Band. That would take a year, often one and a half years where you are paid the minimum wage. The training was pretty bad, you didn\u0026#8217;t get the 20% off-the-job training – 20% of your working time that is – that you are entitled to according to government guidelines for apprenticeships. You would get 1 or 2%, which you would get anyway, as part of the usual on the job courses. That created some tension and a collective grievance against the apprenticeship scheme, which resulted in some people getting back payment of the difference between minimum wage and Band 2 wages. During the apprenticeship scheme for Band 2 they also added a lot of medical tasks, such as glucose testing, medical observations, taking out cannulas and so on, which should be paid Band 3. So the next step was to demand back payment for Band 3 wages, which we also managed to get.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJones:\u003c/strong\u003e All this is now part of the Band 3 pay dispute across the country which my Trust is a part of. Otherwise we do our medical tasks, like ECGs, taking blood samples, putting cannulas in, but we are still paid Band 2. When people are in special breathing machines, such as CPAP or BIPAP, we record the details on the machines when doing medical observations. That should be a Band 3 job, because you have to know what is going on. Originally only trained nurses would do that. Currently we\u0026#8217;re organising a collective grievance to bring to the trust CEO. The HCA reps are not actually \u0026#8216;union reps\u0026#8217;, they are more like contacts for the campaign, normally two or three for each ward. They can take turns in delegating. What worked well was that if one ward didn\u0026#8217;t have a rep, people from another ward would go there and explain what\u0026#8217;s going on. Now we circulate information about disputes elsewhere. We have handed over a signed collective grievance and given statements to the Chief Nurse and Chief Executive, highlighting how many have actually worked above their band undertaking in band 3 clinical duties. After this all HCAs involved in this campaign elected 6 delegates to negotiate our terms with the Chiefs and then the board further up. Now, we are going through a collective vote for potential strike action if our demands are not met and our delegates have met with both the Deputy Chief Executive and Chief Nurse.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJack:\u003c/strong\u003e That sounds better than our situation where there are perhaps three, four HCAs in the entire hospital that would walk around and visit other wards. I mean, it\u0026#8217;s huge, there are forty, fifty different wards or sections, it takes you more than three hours if you want to visit all the staff rooms – I have done that several times. At the moment mainly the Bank HCAs are upset, because for a while there were not many shifts. They also cut the \u0026#8216;allocation on arrival\u0026#8217; shifts, which is a bit like your \u0026#8216;rapid response\u0026#8217;, where they only tell you in the morning where you are going to work that day. These shifts pay 30% to 50% extra. All of this also affects the nurses, because if they only pay Band 2 for a bank shift then we won\u0026#8217;t do things that help them, such as blood sugar tests, medical observations or taking out cannulas. I had a situation where the nurse I worked with asked the staff nurse to call the Bank office to change my shift from Band 2 to Band 3, just because she was so overworked. And they did it straightaway! If you don’t ask, you won’t get!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJones:\u003c/strong\u003e In Germany you had strikes around staffing levels. As an outcome, if you work a certain number of understaffed shifts you are supposed to get extra days off or financial compensation. That puts at least a bit of pressure on management to sort things out. The problem is that people tend to take the money, but are still stressed. Here the unions tend to argue around three corners: we want more money and more money will mean more staff, because more people will want to do the job. I don\u0026#8217;t think that this argument is very effective. The nurses strike in our Trust was a mixed bag, the derogation was done pretty much top down, which meant you had more staff on certain wards during strike days then during normal days. Only some nurses had the courage to leave these wards and come to the picket. The picket was lively, but many people came on their day off. From our ward, with a total of around 40 nurses only three came – three nurses from the Philippines, who arrived two years ago, who are the most hard working, but are also pissed off with the pay level in the UK.

The lack of coordination between the unions was also reflected on the ground in hospitals, e.g. in a major hospital in the south-west, the Joint Union Committee, comprising six different unions, rejected the proposal from a Unison and GMB rep to hold a joint pay rally in front of the hospital. Instead of a visible and collective preparation for the industrial actions, the individual unions limited themselves to emailing, texting, phone banking and other individual outreach to members, plus the very occasional stall in the canteen area. These forms of ‘virtual campaigning’ with a lack of people actually coming together in bigger groups, had already failed during the previous pay campaign, when the unions were still able to blame Covid for their own timidness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt was, therefore, not surprising that during the current pay dispute in England, apart from the RCN, none of the other unions (first and foremost Unsion, the biggest union in the NHS) came close to meeting the legal threshold of 50% membership participation in the industrial ballot. Less than 40% of the members of Unison bothered to take part in the ballot, though over 80% of members who participated did vote in favour of industrial action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fact that the RCN met this threshold might be because of three reasons:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ea) at least in the Midlands, friends reported that there were some ‘ward walks’ of RCN activists in the run-up to the ballot, which might have created more of a mobilisation;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eb) their ‘marketing strategy’ was the most visible, timely, and targeted towards strike action. They had planned their promotional materials in advance, and they were focused on answering specific questions around the possibility of nurses taking industrial action;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ec) the ‘professional nature’ of the RCN, the focus on registered nurses and their professional development created more direct links and a certain cohesion. This apparent strength of the nurses is the weakness of the NHS strike, as other groups of health workers, such as housekeepers, porters, cleaners, health care assistants remained largely absent from the dispute.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe divisions amongst the unions and the top-down nature of decision-making about the strategy of the industrial dispute then became more apparent in Scotland, where unions balloted separately from England and where most unions met the legal threshold for industrial action. Partly because of the wider participation in the industrial ballot, the government in Scotland had increased the pay hike from £1,400, like in England, to £2,200 per year. Despite the new offer still not meeting the pay demand of the unions, the union leaderships across the board decided to re-ballot the membership who rejected the new offer. Despite this rejection, the Unison leadership decided to re-open negotiations with the government, proposing a lower pay increase for Band 5 (general nurses) and above. The Unison leadership recommended accepting it and when 57% of the voting members did so, Unison called on the government in Scotland to implement the pay increase as soon as possible, despite the fact that the RCN continued to ballot their members for a higher increase. The Unison leadership thereby undermined the industrial action of a significant chunk of the workforce in Scotland, signaled good will to the government, and significantly lowered the expectations for the ongoing campaign in England.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col start=\"2\"\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe strike preparation from the government, trust management and the unions\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the hospital in the south-west, management and union reps of the joint union committee met initially in talks that treated the upcoming industrial action as a ‘serious incident’, similar to grave accidents, and started discussing possible derogations and exemptions. In contrast, there was no collective meeting of all unions on how to support the RCN strike and no communication towards the members and workers. The only emails that were sent by Unison and GMB to their own members made clear that, as both unions failed to meet the legal threshold, members could not participate in the RCN strike. Trust management sent emails that they respect the right to strike, but at the same time increased payments for bank workers between mid-December and mid-January by 30% for nurses and 15% for the rest, incentivising people to take on extra shifts. At another trust in the south-west, management offered 50% extra pay for shifts on the strike day of the 20th of December.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the meantime, the government, at least initially during the week before the first strike day, added some stick to these carrots. On the 7th of December, they first threatened to legally ban strikes in the health sector, but that threat was not repeated until a month later. On the 10th of December they then spoke publicly about using army personnel to replace striking workers. This turned out to be a paper-tiger early on, as the number of potential soldiers was very low (around 600 army drivers and 150 logistical staff compared to a total of 16,000 plus ambulance paramedics who were balloted to strike) as they often lacked the necessary qualifications and knowledge. There were also voices amongst the military that criticised the government’s announcement as it threatened to ‘undermine the morale amongst the troops’, if they felt that they would be used as pawns in industrial actions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn England the RCN leadership decided to limit the first round of strikes to 44 trusts out of the 102\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003ethat met the legal threshold for strike action (out of 215 eligible in England). There might have been an ‘escalation tactic’ behind the decision to call out only a smaller number of workers, but it caused frustration amongst those members that had voted in favour of industrial action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn tandem with this, the main way to limit the impact of the strike action was the co-management between the RCN and the NHS hierarchy of the so-called ‘derogation’, the exemption of certain departments from the strike and/or the imposition of minimum staffing levels on certain wards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col start=\"3\"\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe issue of strike exemption and derogation \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe question of which departments would be subjected to derogation was handled by the top-level of the RCN, together with the medical authorities. Some of the decisions, e.g. to add mental health and community services to the derogated areas caused minor discontent amongst rank-and-file members, but was never openly contested. After the general field of the strike was staked out from above, local RCN reps and committees then decided about minimum staffing levels during the strike. Before we look at how this was done in concrete we should state that this issue is at the heart of the question of who is in control of the strike. Workers on each ward know best what their current patients need in terms of minimum health and safety and would be able to coordinate how many workers can participate in the strike. This act in itself would have boosted a sense of collective control and power. Instead, the way that derogation was negotiated between a few RCN reps and management left a lot of scope for confusion, sometimes deliberately caused by arbitrary management communication, about ‘the right to strike’, and most workers felt pretty manipulated by or disengaged from the process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the trust in the south-west, a very small number of reps negotiated the derogation for all medical wards, stipulating that during the strike days there should be a minimum of four registered nurses and five healthcare assistants. The irony is that even on the best days there are hardly ever five healthcare assistants on the wards, more often than not there are three. The union justified these minimum staffing levels that objectively limited the amount of possible strikers with the following argument: ‘as a union we campaign generally for better staffing levels, so how can we, when asked, agree to low minimum levels during strike days?’\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMany nurses and RCN members were pretty upset about these minimum staffing levels,\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eas they allowed management to declare that no one who is scheduled to work could go on strike\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e– even though this wasn’t actually true. There were many individual texts and emails from ward managers to people who they suspected would go on strike – allegedly in order to be able to ‘plan for the strike days’. In some wards, managers ‘allowed’ workers to go on strike, often for a limited amount of hours. If your ward sister was more supportive of the strike, it was easier to agree your participation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEven if this was not intended by the RCN, the way that the derogation process was handled left the management of the strike largely in the hands of the trust hierarchy. We heard of a few cases where nurses decided collectively on a ward level how many and how long to attend the strike picket – more about that below. There was also an individual case where management and nurses complained about ‘intimidation’ by RCN reps who walked around the wards and checked how many people were working and how many were on strike – in general the number of RCN reps and activists were too low to actually ‘sweep’ the wards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThings were similar in the hospital up north. “In our Trust the list of derogated areas grew longer by the day, with what seemed like the whole hospital derogated from strike action. The Trust also encouraged staff to think that striking in derogated areas wasn’t allowed, but this felt like it backfired, and a number of staff who weren’t going to strike did so as they felt like the Trust was trying to minimise the impact, and thought they’d been slightly deceptive in trying to do this.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the hospital in the Midlands, the picture varied a bit. A comrade reported the following about the derogation process:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“In our trust there was a quite large derogation committee, made up of non-rep members from across a wide range of areas. Most of these members had not been involved in the RCN before the ballot, they only got involved in ward walks and in spreading the word about the ballot during this pay campaign. However, despite the large committee recruited from the membership I think everyone was at least a band 6. The general attitude (including from the RCN officials involved) was one of wanting to go relatively hard on saying no to the derogation, but there was a lack of confidence at times, and second guessing. The trust sent in very few requests for derogations in the first week when the strike committee was meeting and then bombarded it with an unmanageable amount in the last few days. This might have been a deliberate attempt by management to sabotage the committee or confusion on their part about the actual numbers of strikers, or both. In the end, the trust asked for a blanket derogation of the wards, to which the reply was: ‘Well, we already said you could have night-shift staffing numbers on strike days, that’s enough. If you don’t have these numbers on the day, come to us’ (with some back and forth in the committee on how strongly to put this)…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the end, this only created more confusion, in part because of the difference between the on- paper night numbers and the real ones. On the day there was an attempt to encourage staff to leave if it was over the normal night number, but this had mixed results. One member of the strike committee ended up being accused of bullying by senior management while doing this, this was at a different site to mine within the same trust. We also know that on several wards they lied about the amount of staff on the ward and had prepared staff to repeat these lies when asked. I know that at least some members of staff left the wards after seeing the numbers were higher than needed and one derogated team decided that their derogation was too generous on the first day and independently chose to decrease their numbers on the second day. There was also continuous fight over the derogation of one postoperative area, which the trust claimed was a High Dependency Unit (covered by national derogation), but which the staff that were working there stated was not. In the end, the professional body side of the RCN got involved, stating, “we helped develop the model of care this ward uses and wrote the definition, it’s not a HDU”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col start=\"4\"\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe actual impact of the strike\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s difficult to assess the actual impact of the strike on a national level. The Guardian quoted a NHS senior manager after the first day of strike who claimed:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e“I think we do know that there were some real pressure points around emergency departments, for example, including things like the slow transfer of patients out of those departments.In terms of things like routine operations, so far we’ve heard that probably between around 40 to 60% of those routine operations have been cancelled in places where the strikes were held.” \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn a hospital level, the impact of the strike differed sharply from ward to ward. In the hospital in the south-west, some workers reported that they actually had higher staffing levels on the strike day than normally, in particular in the emergency department. On other wards, colleagues said that matrons and managers had to do bed care and bring patients to the toilet – which can clearly be stated as a positive result of the industrial action in terms of educational value (“it’s good if they get their hands dirty every now and then”). On a more subjective note, it seemed that there were more relatives of patients around, perhaps in reaction to the strike, anticipating that a few extra hands were needed for personal care – but that might also have been due to Christmas approaching.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the Midlands we received news regarding the use of military personnel: “My trust has a large amount of military staff working in it. In one case a decision was made not to derogate any members of staff on a ward (even down to the reduced night-shift numbers) based on the knowledge that it would have enough military nurses to staff it that day. The military nurses, however, refused to work until someone came up from the picket line to take the handover. In the end one person agreed to go up until 11 am. Apart from this, several elective services were stopped and some wards truly were at minimal staffing numbers, but others were actually above the standard numbers due to the confusion created by the process and the difference between the real standard numbers and the official night numbers.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col start=\"5\"\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOn the picket lines\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe level of participation in the picket lines can be seen as another indicator for the mood amongst those on strike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn one south-west hospital, the RCN reps were first of all concerned with the legal nature of the picket. In the run-up, various leading reps of the joint union committee said that, for example, there should be no loudspeakers and music on the picket, as ‘we would lose support from the public’. This hospital’s actual picket was placed 300 meters away from the main entrance of the hospital. The picket itself was pretty lively, with around 80 people participating at each given point, with a relatively high turnover, also due to the weather – out of a total of 10,000 people who are employed at the hospital. The lively mood was also partly due to the fact that official guidance was ignored and music was playing. It was good to see that many nurses came in ward groups, but then they often also seemed to stay in their groups. From my ward, only four nurses came, though it was good to see that it was recently hired nurses from the Philippines. Also good to see that there were many self-made placards, perhaps even more than official union ones. There were mainly young nurses in their 20s, early 30s, unfortunately only a handful of HCAs, no porters or cleaners or housekeepers. It was good to see groups of student nurses. There were no speeches, which is good, in the sense that we did not have to listen to any ‘official talks’, but bad in the sense that there was nothing that would create collective discussion. Pat Cullen, the RCN leader, did pop by on a whistlestop picket tour, too. People mainly seemed to enjoy each other’s company and the shared discontent with the government, but there were not many discussions about how to strike. There were only three CWU reps and one RMT rep who came for a visit, but they didn’t address all strikers. The main discussion was that the derogation was arbitrary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt another south-west hospital, around 100 nurses and supporters were directly outside the hospital and facing a main road. There was lots of public support. There were official picket stewards, but no real distanced separation between them and other strikers/supporters, which was nice to see.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the Midlands in general there was a very positive attitude on the picket line, people were excited to be there. Despite the RCN ban on amplified sound and heavy emphasis on the official limits on picket size and having additional supporters separate, we ended up having speeches, music and a crowd of around 200 with no clear separation of the official picket. There was a high level of support for the picket from the public and non-nursing members of staff. We had so much food donated that we had to go round the ward to share it out for the night shift. On the first day there were issues of the senior management hanging out around the picket and the strike committee meeting room. They were trying to get people to come up by arguing that the wards were not at safe levels. This did not occur as much on the second day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the hospital in the north there were mostly nurses in attendance, with some domestics and others as well. Staffing levels and stress and being overworked were common themes as much as pay. It felt like it had glimmers of some confidence and a more general ‘fuck it’ attitude as well. We also read about a few ‘unofficial actions’ when it came to the picket lines from a WhatsApp group:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I’m an RCN member and nurse working in Norfolk. Our picket line was set in Luton last week and it is as far away again on Tuesday. A fabulous like-minded group of amazing nurses started their own unofficial picket at the car park next to Havenbridge House (Great Yarmouth) last week and since then they’ve managed to get RCN to support and change the picket line from unofficial to official!!!!”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col start=\"6\"\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReaction of the government and the union since the strike\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe initial threat by the government to ban the strike legally or to undermine it by use of the military remained empty, while the effort by parts of the media to portray nurses as ruthless and greedy people on middle-incomes also largely backfired. According to surveys the public support for the nurses is still high. Meanwhile, Labour continues their anti-strike stance, with the shadow health secretary vowing to fight ‘hostile NHS unions’ that oppose necessary restructuring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe union itself used a relatively weak strategy by offering to ‘call off strikes in return for talks’ before the first strike days and by halving the pay demand from an above inflation increase to a below inflation increase (another real wage cut) ‘in return for talks’ before the second round of strikes in January. The RCN hopes that portraying the government as ‘unwilling to negotiate’ alone is enough to get results. This strategy might backfire in various ways. Firstly, by trying to ‘blame the government for the strike because they are unwilling to negotiate’ portrays the strike itself as a negative thing, which weakens workers once they decide to continue the industrial action in a more offensive manner. Secondly, by offering to lower the pay demand without consulting the members they further undermine the sentiment that members themselves are in the drivers’’ seat. You can only blow hot and cold so many times before people get fed up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the Midlands there has been a recognition of the need for greater intelligence gathering based on the response of frontline nurses on the real numbers on the ward as opposed to the official establishment numbers. This could provide an opening for an inquiry based grassroots engagement and taking the lead in the struggle from union officials.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnother problematic decision by the RCN was to exclude those hospitals who went on strike in December from the strikes in January. This caused confusion and a feeling of being ‘managed’ by the union. The comrade from the north wrote: “We have more RCN strike days coming in January, but the RCN has split the Trusts striking and ours isn’t, which has annoyed staff that I’ve talked to.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe negotiation circus continued in January. After the RCN lowered their initial demand the government softened their first stance and offered talks and a possible ‘one off payment’ in the form of ‘hardship relief’. Already in December some Tory MPs had already urged the party leadership to negotiate. For the government it becomes a gamble of how to tame the rail, postal and NHS strikes that are happening at the same time. To ‘buy off’ the RCN might be a way to come down hard on the rail and postal strike. While the unions might schedule their strikes to coincide on the same day, we cannot expect the RMT, CWU and RCN to actively and explicitly join up their strikes, in terms of continuing their action until all of the respective unions’ demands are met.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col start=\"7\"\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eProposals\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe don’t have major proposals at this point in time, but the following activities might be fruitful:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDiscuss the first round of strikes and share your experiences – we are happy to circulate them;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDiscuss with colleagues, first and foremost with health workers who have not been part of the strike, such as porters, cleaners or HCAs, how we can strengthen the strike and make our voices heard;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGo in bigger groups of health workers to actively support pickets of other strikers and make them as effective as possible;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDiscuss the positive and negative experience of your strike with workers on strike at the railways, at Royal Mail and other places;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTry to find out more about how the ‘minimum service’ derogation was organised during the more successful health strikes, such as in Germany;\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePicket private clinics during strike days in order to cause more financial damage – of course considering patients’ health and safety.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n"}}]}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/posts/[slug]","query":{"slug":"nhs-pay-dispute-from-below-online-newsletter-no-1-2021"},"buildId":"CrL1x7qoG-wfhW0NKG71u","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
