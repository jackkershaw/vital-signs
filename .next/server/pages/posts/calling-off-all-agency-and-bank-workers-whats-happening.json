In Leeds, the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-leeds-69028913\">Teaching Hospital  </a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">announced to save £110 million in the year ahead. The director of finance: &#8220;We have identified a need to further reduce our pay spend on bank and agency staff because over recent years we&#8217;ve made a significant increase in permanent clinical staff.” We all know that actually more permanent nurses leave the job than management is able to hire, so cutting bank and agency shifts will mean a deterioration of staffing levels and more stress for everyone, including patients.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The situation seems similar at our two hospitals in Bristol. Here are a couple of statements from friends:</span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I work in theatres, where they have drastically cut agency work. These colleagues have been with us a long time, sometimes for years. We built close relationships. It is true, they hired new people, but at the moment nearly two thirds of the theatre staff has been in the job less than a year. This means a lot of knowledge is gone together with the agency colleagues. And many experienced permanent staff also leave and shift to private hospitals. Operating Department Practitioners on agency contracts said that their wages might be reduced in summer and they are thinking about leaving. We should have opposed these cuts!” </span></em></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I work bank shifts as a nursing assistant and currently the trust won’t put out any ‘allocation on arrival’ shifts anymore. They also cancelled some of my AOA shifts. These shifts were important to make ends meet at the end of the month. Everyone sits on their phones and tries to snap up the rare Saturday and Sunday shifts as soon as they appear. People are getting a bit desperate. Shifts for agency nurses have also been cancelled. They ask bank staff if they want to work in Weston”</span></em></p>\n<p><strong>Cancel culture</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The current reduction of bank shifts comes shortly after another disappointment for bank HCAs. Unlike their permanent co-workers they didn’t receive a back payment for having done Band 3 work for a Band 2 wage. It is still often the case that shifts are booked as Band 2, but bank workers are expected to perform medical tasks, such as glucose tests or clinical observations.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bank work is a fairly new thing and at the time when the trusts introduced it there was discontent amongst hospital workers. It was clear that they would try to cut over-time shifts, which have to be paid at 1.5 rate, and replace these with cheaper bank shifts. And that’s what happened. Even now some colleagues work bank shifts on top of their 37.5 hours and are paid only the single, not the overtime rate. The dimensions are considerable. We don&#8217;t have current figures, but a couple of years ago the BRI alone employed 1,600 workers on bank contracts.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We live in a market society, where money counts more than human needs and relationships. We can understand colleagues who leave their permanent jobs because they can earn more as agency workers or because bank work gives more ‘flexibility’. This works out as long as there are shifts on offer, and we experience that we get into trouble <a href=\"https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/nhs-southmead-hospital-furlough-coronavirus-4082655\">when there are none</a>.</span><b> </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We also know that relationships at work suffer when people come and go.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We want to create solidarity between people who work together, no matter their contract. But perhaps now is the time to demand permanent jobs at better pay rates and with more freedom to arrange our shifts around other needs?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The current cuts are not a natural necessity, they are an attack and should be treated as such.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Tell us what you think and how you cope with the situation!</strong></p>\n"},"posts":{"edges":[{"node":{"title":"Issue no.1 – The Letting Game – Letting you down","excerpt":"<p>Imagine 18,000 hospital workers blocking the M32 or the port in Avonmouth depot demanding a rent cap for Bristol!

Forget about it. £700 for a dingy box as big as the domestics’ cupboard, no sitting room. My ward colleagues come over from Newport or Gloucester. That&#8217;s a two hour drive on top of a 12.5 hour shift. That can be fatal. Another nurse tells me how he offered the landlord £50 extra per month rent, because he is so desperate. Still no success. He lives with his wife and small child in one room, in the flat of his brother. Have you tried to sleep after a night-shift with a toddler in the room?! Young colleagues, and we&#8217;re talking mid-30s here, still live with their parents, despite pretty toxic dynamics. It will be hard to grow up if you stay under the infantalising gaze of your mum and dad!</p>\n<p>Most houses in Bristol are old and run down anyway. They have been paid off a dozen times! Back in the day, when the working class movement was strong enough, the state would build houses particularly for nurses! In 1939 there was a successful rent strike in Birmingham when the council tried to implement a rent increase in the name of the war effort. Working class women were having none of it, and thousands of them refused to pay their rent until the council changed their mind.</p>\n<p>During the last bigger teachers, railway, postal and nurses strikes in 2023 a union platform emerged, called ‘Enough is Enough’. In Bristol, 300 people came to the founding event. One of their demands was a rent cap. A good idea, but because the law doesn’t allow ‘political strikes’ the unions were too scared to actually attach this demand to the strikes. And there was too much competition between the unions about who should lead ‘Enough is Enough’, so the whole thing tanked.</p>\n<p>Another campaign emerged, called ‘Don’t Pay’, calling for a mass boycott of inflated energy bills. Thousands of people joined the campaign online, but online campaigns are not enough. But that doesn’t mean that we can’t do anything! Between the two hospitals we are 18,000 people! Imagine 18,000 people blocking the M32 or the port in Avonmouth depot demanding a rent cap for Bristol!</p>\n<p>In the meantime we can support each other with problems with landlords.

And what do they get in return for working 12-hour shifts? They get the privilege to pay for that pleasurable experience themselves. If you want to become a nurse in other European countries they at least have the decency to pay you. For students the rent situation is even more atrocious! No wonder that still one in four nursing students don’t finish their degree and that in 2022 there were 10% less new student nurses compared to the previous years. While 40,000 nurses left the job that year, less than 30,000 student nurses enrolled.</p>\n<p>Medical and nursing students come in with a fresh eye and aspirations. For them the contrast between the ideal to put patients first and the reality of a health system in crisis appears still sharp and painful. The hope that we don’t just medicate patients, but that we get to the roots of what is making them and us sick is often crushed by hospital daily-life. We really need their fresh view and idealism! Most of us got a bit jaded by the job and had to accept things as they are. We should ask them how they see the new world they enter!</p>\n<p>And they develop a lot of experiences during their various placements, from hospital to community settings. They can build a bridge between the hospital and the university. Social changes often started in universities and if we look at places like France we still see a lot of positive rebellious energies coming out of them. In Germany the group Kritische Medizinstudierende (<em>critical medical students</em>) discuss the shortcomings of the curriculum together, develop a more critical understanding of what role poverty and oppression has when it comes to illness, and they support local strikes of fellow health workers.</p>\n<p>In the coming issues of Vital Signs we will interview nursing and medical students about their experiences.

A woman with her two daughters entered the stage. She told us that she worked as a nurse at Southmead and that she is from Tibet. She spoke out against oppression and the three performed a traditional dance.</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Health workers are often at the forefront of movements against war and state violence. From Myanmar to Sudan to Gaza to Iran. Some of these workers end up working on the wards with us. Colleagues have made long journeys and worked in many different settings, from small towns in Kerala to Delhi, to Dubai or Durban to end up in Bristol, of all places. The fact that a small country like the UK can hoover up the nurses of the rest of the globe is not a coincidence. It has a lot to do with colonialism in the past and current military operations, from Iraq to Yemen, at the side of the US state. It is not that health workers are not needed in rural India, the Philippines or Nigeria, the opposite is true, but the global market pushes us around. We have to go where the jobs are, where the money is. We can see this as a tragedy or as a chance to learn from each other, how to build a world where human needs are at the centre, not money. Nurses in Kerala have a tradition of struggle, for example against temporary contracts. And international health workers in the UK are organising themselves – check out <a href=\"http://PAN AFRICAN WORKERS ASSOCIATION (PAWA) – Organising Care Workers in the UK\">PAWA</a> for example.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UK is still a relatively rich country, but that doesn’t mean that nurses here are rich. As you can read in the report from a trainer of international nurses below, a lot of colleagues are not told how expensive things are here, especially the rent or to renew a family visa. Once you are here, your contract makes it difficult to change jobs. I remember a conversation with a colleague from Ghana who said that now she has to ask her family back home to send money, while it should be the other way around really. We want to hear from you how your journey has been! </span></p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conversation with a nurse who trains overseas nurses</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I worked for a Community Interest Company (CIC), training foreign community nurses. The CIC had a big deficit of community nurses, they were struggling to recruit from the UK. They received funding from NHS England to recruit 20 international nurses. Most of the recruitment of foreign nurses in Asia and Africa is done by one specific NHS trust in our area, they have created a particular recruitment centre. They have a kind of monopoly, because they have been doing it for a long time. They do that work for lots of hospitals in the region. I think they are being paid for that. They would go out to the Philippines, India, Dubai, doing job interviews and offering people different jobs in the UK. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the work contract of the new recruits it said that they would have to stay with the organisation for three years, otherwise they would have to pay back the recruitment costs. I went to a Unison talk and they said the organisation cannot actually enforce this. But then the visa is attached to employment in a particular trust. The visa is given only for certain job categories where there is a local shortage. It is for one person only, but workers can get a spousal visa. One nurse left her very young son with her sister, she thought they could both move to the UK later on, but unfortunately it has to be a spouse. She looked at childcare costs and shift-patterns and realised that she couldn’t bring her son here. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It took ages to get the visas, and finding accommodation in the area was also very difficult. This would take months. There is also the issue of so-called ‘red countries’. There are countries that are red-listed that we cannot actively recruit from, because they don’t have enough health care professionals. But if you put a job vacancy out and someone from these countries applies, that’s fine. Nigeria is one of these countries, Zimbabwe, too. One trust developed an e-learning program that nurses were supposed to go through before arriving in the UK. But many nurses work 12 hour shifts in their home countries and have little time for extra work, in particular if that work is not paid for. There is also a problem with middleman culture, for example when it comes to Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) training or English training. I met several nurses who paid private companies in their home countries for extra training. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the recruits arrived they would have a mix of education and working as supernumeraries on the wards, and they were paid as Band 4. The nurses had to have passed their English exam and CBT (Computer Based Test) before arriving in the UK and they would then pass their OSCE. They wanted the nurses to pass the OSCE within three months, but there were no slots at the five test centres in the UK, which are linked to universities. The only place where we could get places was in Newcastle, which is miles away, so they had to fly there for the test. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The OSCE that they have to pass is phenomenally difficult. They had to go through ten stations, which could be a multitude of different skills. Skills that many qualified nurses wouldn’t pass. It’s different from your normal nursing degree; I didn’t have to pass any OSCE. We, as an organisation, paid for their first attempt. It’s £700 for the first test and £300 for the following attempts, which the nurses would have to pay themselves. The £700 are for an individual slot, for a one day exam. The money goes to the exam centres. The failure rate has gone up. If you fail less than seven stations you only have to retake the ones that you failed. So we had cases of people who had to travel back to Newcastle for a six minute test. Another problem was that as a community nurse in the UK you have to drive. I think it said in their contract that they would have to own a car within six months. Workers, on one hand, didn’t know how expensive a car, insurance, emission charges, taxes and so on are in the UK. I know that several nurses felt hood-winked around the car situation.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of the nurses, in particular from Africa, had to face a lot of micro-aggressions in the rural areas, for example on public buses, in their accommodation or in local stores. In one case we had to move a nurse out of that situation, because it was detrimental to her health. She was grateful, but it was us who got her in that situation in the first place. We are not doing her a favour by recruiting her for positions that we can’t fill. Still, the official rhetoric is: “we brought you to the UK, we will provide you with all these things, aren’t we great”, and so on. Most of the nurses arrive without any local connections, they don’t have friends or relatives here. Men are even more isolated than women, because they are in the minority in nursing. A couple of our nurses knew some people in a trust nearby though. I know that there is a big Filipino nurses’ Facebook group where people share experiences. But there are also formal organisations. There is a Zimbabwe nurses’ association, but it is not that big in this area. There are churches, as well. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I left the job because it became slightly uncomfortable. I felt they were trapping international nurses and I felt that I didn’t have any power to change that. There is pretty much a picture painted that the streets here are paved with gold. When they turn up the reality is extremely different. The whole discussion around the red list country thing also became difficult. I also saw that they were not really recruiting. It also didn’t make sense business-wise, as a model. Last year 9,000 international nurses left the UK again to work further afield, together with 4,000 local nurses, because local wages are low. You were recruiting against the tide, that’s how it felt. I saw that this project would end at some point. I also missed working with patients.</span></p>\n"}}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
