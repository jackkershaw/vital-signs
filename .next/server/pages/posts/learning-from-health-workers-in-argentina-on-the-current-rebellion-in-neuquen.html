But they have found ways to make themselves heard. Read more about this below. If you are interested in discussing our situation as health workers and the current pay campaign, get in touch: vitalsignsmag@proton.me</em></p>
<p>What started as a health workers’ dispute has turned into a regional uprising. Since early March, health workers throughout the province of Neuquén in Argentina have been staging unofficial strikes and roadblocks, demanding a pay rise higher than the miserable deal agreed by the government and the unions. They also demanding better working conditions to face what is expected to be the second wave of coronavirus in Argentina. The health system is not up to the task. Increased layoffs of critical care nurses and emergency paramedics over the past year have exacerbated staffing shortages. This dispute has turned into a bigger movement, and a self-organised one at that. Workers have been setting up a strike fund and holding open meetings at the hospital entrances. After being ignored, the movement has escalated their tactics by using roadblocks to obstruct the province’s oil and gas production.</p>
<div class="wordads-ad-wrapper">
<div id="atatags-26942-851726" data-adtags-width="740"><strong>Background of the dispute</strong></div>
</div>
<p>In December 2019, the provincial government froze public sector wages. This meant a 26% loss of purchasing power for health sector workers in the midst of the 2020 pandemic. The vaccination campaign, which began in early 2021, is slow to get off the ground while Argentina is caught up in the second wave of the pandemic.</p>
<p><strong>Why has it kicked off now?</strong></p>
<p>On February 24th this year, the provincial government offered a 12% wage increase to health workers. On February 25th, the union’s grassroots assemblies in about 20 hospitals and health centres rejected this proposal. Union General Secretary Carlos Quintriqueo ignored this vote, and on Feb. 26th, the union leadership accepted the government’s deal. This fierce betrayal of union (ATE) representatives was the straw that broke the camel’s back.</p>
<p>On March 2nd, a large inter-hospital meeting of health workers was held in the centre of Neuquén, the provincial capital. They decided to demand that wage negotiations be resumed, a 40% increase for 2020 and an adjustment in line with inflation for 2021. They also decided to coordinate their demands with the teachers’ union, ATEN, and to draw up a joint action plan. ATEN had rejected the same wage proposal a few days earlier, and decided not to resume classes on March 3rd.</p>
<p>At the same time, various conflicts were spreading in the region. Social movements blocked rural road bridges and other points for an increase in support programs; schools throughout the province made demands of the state; and the feminist movement took to the streets against the femicide of Guadalupe Curual in Villa La Angostura. On March 10th, self-organized health workers, opposition to the ATEN union leadership, other public sector workers, workers in the self-managed tile factories, and social movements came together in a demonstration that ended at the main government building. On March 12th, health workers with the union of justice workers (SEJUN) blocked the bridges between Neuquén and Cipolletti. Meanwhile, ATEN maintained a protest camp in front of the government building. There was still no response from the political side.</p>
<p>On March 16th, the provincial government agreed to add 3% to the wage increase, for a total of 15%. At the same time, the health workers rehearsed a first blockade of the oil route, the roads through which the project of Vaca Muerta is carried out. (Vaca Muerta is an oil shale deposit where they’re fracking). The government continued to refuse to meet with the self-organized workers. ATEN’s union leadership pushed through the approval of the wage proposal, even though it meant a significant loss of wages. On the same day, the Cerámica Neuquén tile factory (which had been taken over by the workers*) was again threatened with eviction and auction.</p>
<p>On March 24th, (the anniversary of the 1976 coup), thousands again took to the streets. In addition to the usual demands for commemoration, truth and justice, health was big on peoples’ agenda, demonstrating the broad legitimacy health workers now had amongst the wider population. More roadblocks, this time to famous tourist destinations, resulted in more clashes. The traffic chaos and growing criticism of a continued lack of response from the government emboldened health sector workers to expand their struggle further.</p>
<div class="wordads-ad-wrapper">
<div id="atatags-26942-551511" data-adtags-width="740"><strong>Oil and gas blockades</strong></div>
</div>
<p>The Neuquén area is known for its oil and gas industry. On April 7th, a series of indefinite blockades began at strategic points along the oil route, focussing on Añelo, the neuralgic centre of Vaca Muerta. Through the roadblocks, workers have been mainly targeting the trucks transporting fuel from the Vaca Muerta refinery, while letting the rest of the drivers pass. The blockades have made it difficult to drill new wells, forcing the closure of smaller wells, and causing problems at processing plants that threaten Buenos Aires’ gas supply.</p>
<p>As the government continued its silence, the number of blockades increased to twelve by April 10th. For the last two weeks, 30 roadblocks have paralysed the activities of the petroleum industry in Vaca Muerta.</p>
<p>In parallel, a meeting was convened with social movements, unions, parties and local organizations in the city of Neuquén at the Castro Rendón Hospital, the largest hospital in the province. A few hours after this meeting, the state energy company of the province, EPEN, cut off the electricity to the worker-run Zanon-FaSinPat tile factory.</p>
<p>At first, the authorities had maintained that pay rise negotiations would only take place with the unions and refused to meet with the strikers. Finally, after weeks of unofficial actions, the provincial government agreed to meet the protestors but after a couple of meetings, which the workers considered unproductive and a waste of their time, they decided to leave the negotiation table until there was an acceptable pay rise proposal from the government.</p>
<p><em>“We left our answer on the table and told them that we are not going to accept any more teasing, as they did yesterday (Friday 16th) when they kept us for 9 hours in sterile discussions. When they have a proposal for an increase in the basic pay, they can call us and we will sit down to discuss it. In the meantime we will continue to hold roadblocks and deepen the measures.”</em> said one of the representatives of the workers, after last Saturday’s meeting.</p>
<p>Throughout all this, the Mapuche communities in the Añelo area have been joining the pickets. The situation with the truck drivers has gone from conflicts and counter-pickets to solidarity. Workers have joined in solidarity and stayed outside the Ciudad Judicial where the negotiation meetings were held.<br />
Meanwhile, almost all the union leaders not only do not support the strike but even openly attack it, like the leader of ATE Neuquén. The union leaders aligned with the Kirchner government, who went so far as to consider that it should be repressed, forcing all the sectional delegates to sign this declaration, which some of them denounced.</p>
<p>Despite the position of the union leaders, on the roads and in the streets of Neuquén, there is massive participation of health workers and massive support of teachers, as well as the active support of various militant unemployed movements. In addition, most of the oil workers and truck drivers appear to be getting closer to the health workers, despite the significant physical and monetary wear and tear that being stranded on the roads causes them on a daily basis. Some helped to block supply products for fracking, and have been maintaining food supplies.</p>
<p>Last week ended with a strike by the teachers’ union ATEN and the judiciary union SEJUN, which issued a joint statement with various unions at the Universidad del Comahue. It was a strike in solidarity with the health sector. The union leaders, under pressure from their own rank and file and large public support, could no longer stay out of it.</p>
<div class="wordads-ad-wrapper">
<div id="atatags-26942-963534" data-adtags-width="740">In a recent statement, the workers declared that: <em>¨(…) In the face of any offer from the government, it will be the assemblies of the hospitals and health centres, including the comrades who are on the different picket lines on the routes, who will decide whether to accept or reject it. If our rebellion was because a group of leaders decided on a miserable increase behind our backs, it will continue to be the rank and file who will decide the next steps. We call on the workers in each hospital and health centre to continue fighting for our decent pay and working conditions to continue in the front line of care for the population in this pandemic and the community to continue to support us.¨</em></div>
</div>
<p><strong>Effects of the uprising so far… </strong></p>
<p>The management tried to get oil workers to denounce health workers. Without success. The contractors complain about losses of millions. But the health workers’ struggle has also revealed that oil companies are raking in millions in profits every day. Another success of the ‘elephants’ (that’s what the health workers call their movement).</p>
<p><em>“We work in conditions of overwork and overtiredness. We’ve had to maintain daily operations, with a lack of materials and rudimentary equipment.” Since early March 2021, the staff of the Centenario Hospital in the Argentine city of Neuquén has been on strike against planned austerity measures. The women are at the forefront of this. They are fighting against deteriorating working conditions and trying to make up for the loss of childcare in the pandemic.

We haven’t found our own ways yet to do something about this. Health workers in Argentina don’t have it easier than us. Their conditions are similarly bad, if not worse. But they have found ways to make themselves heard. Read more about this below. If you are interested in discussing our situation as health workers and the current pay campaign, get in touch: vitalsignsmag@proton.me\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat started as a health workers’ dispute has turned into a regional uprising. Since early March, health workers throughout the province of Neuquén in Argentina have been staging unofficial strikes and roadblocks, demanding a pay rise higher than the miserable deal agreed by the government and the unions. They also demanding better working conditions to face what is expected to be the second wave of coronavirus in Argentina. The health system is not up to the task. Increased layoffs of critical care nurses and emergency paramedics over the past year have exacerbated staffing shortages. This dispute has turned into a bigger movement, and a self-organised one at that. Workers have been setting up a strike fund and holding open meetings at the hospital entrances. After being ignored, the movement has escalated their tactics by using roadblocks to obstruct the province’s oil and gas production.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"wordads-ad-wrapper\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"atatags-26942-851726\" data-adtags-width=\"740\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBackground of the dispute\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn December 2019, the provincial government froze public sector wages. This meant a 26% loss of purchasing power for health sector workers in the midst of the 2020 pandemic. The vaccination campaign, which began in early 2021, is slow to get off the ground while Argentina is caught up in the second wave of the pandemic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy has it kicked off now?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn February 24th this year, the provincial government offered a 12% wage increase to health workers. On February 25th, the union’s grassroots assemblies in about 20 hospitals and health centres rejected this proposal. Union General Secretary Carlos Quintriqueo ignored this vote, and on Feb. 26th, the union leadership accepted the government’s deal. This fierce betrayal of union (ATE) representatives was the straw that broke the camel’s back.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn March 2nd, a large inter-hospital meeting of health workers was held in the centre of Neuquén, the provincial capital. They decided to demand that wage negotiations be resumed, a 40% increase for 2020 and an adjustment in line with inflation for 2021. They also decided to coordinate their demands with the teachers’ union, ATEN, and to draw up a joint action plan. ATEN had rejected the same wage proposal a few days earlier, and decided not to resume classes on March 3rd.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, various conflicts were spreading in the region. Social movements blocked rural road bridges and other points for an increase in support programs; schools throughout the province made demands of the state; and the feminist movement took to the streets against the femicide of Guadalupe Curual in Villa La Angostura. On March 10th, self-organized health workers, opposition to the ATEN union leadership, other public sector workers, workers in the self-managed tile factories, and social movements came together in a demonstration that ended at the main government building. On March 12th, health workers with the union of justice workers (SEJUN) blocked the bridges between Neuquén and Cipolletti. Meanwhile, ATEN maintained a protest camp in front of the government building. There was still no response from the political side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn March 16th, the provincial government agreed to add 3% to the wage increase, for a total of 15%. At the same time, the health workers rehearsed a first blockade of the oil route, the roads through which the project of Vaca Muerta is carried out. (Vaca Muerta is an oil shale deposit where they’re fracking). The government continued to refuse to meet with the self-organized workers. ATEN’s union leadership pushed through the approval of the wage proposal, even though it meant a significant loss of wages. On the same day, the Cerámica Neuquén tile factory (which had been taken over by the workers*) was again threatened with eviction and auction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn March 24th, (the anniversary of the 1976 coup), thousands again took to the streets. In addition to the usual demands for commemoration, truth and justice, health was big on peoples’ agenda, demonstrating the broad legitimacy health workers now had amongst the wider population. More roadblocks, this time to famous tourist destinations, resulted in more clashes. The traffic chaos and growing criticism of a continued lack of response from the government emboldened health sector workers to expand their struggle further.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"wordads-ad-wrapper\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"atatags-26942-551511\" data-adtags-width=\"740\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOil and gas blockades\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Neuquén area is known for its oil and gas industry. On April 7th, a series of indefinite blockades began at strategic points along the oil route, focussing on Añelo, the neuralgic centre of Vaca Muerta. Through the roadblocks, workers have been mainly targeting the trucks transporting fuel from the Vaca Muerta refinery, while letting the rest of the drivers pass. The blockades have made it difficult to drill new wells, forcing the closure of smaller wells, and causing problems at processing plants that threaten Buenos Aires’ gas supply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the government continued its silence, the number of blockades increased to twelve by April 10th. For the last two weeks, 30 roadblocks have paralysed the activities of the petroleum industry in Vaca Muerta.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn parallel, a meeting was convened with social movements, unions, parties and local organizations in the city of Neuquén at the Castro Rendón Hospital, the largest hospital in the province. A few hours after this meeting, the state energy company of the province, EPEN, cut off the electricity to the worker-run Zanon-FaSinPat tile factory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first, the authorities had maintained that pay rise negotiations would only take place with the unions and refused to meet with the strikers. Finally, after weeks of unofficial actions, the provincial government agreed to meet the protestors but after a couple of meetings, which the workers considered unproductive and a waste of their time, they decided to leave the negotiation table until there was an acceptable pay rise proposal from the government.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e“We left our answer on the table and told them that we are not going to accept any more teasing, as they did yesterday (Friday 16th) when they kept us for 9 hours in sterile discussions. When they have a proposal for an increase in the basic pay, they can call us and we will sit down to discuss it. In the meantime we will continue to hold roadblocks and deepen the measures.”\u003c/em\u003e said one of the representatives of the workers, after last Saturday’s meeting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThroughout all this, the Mapuche communities in the Añelo area have been joining the pickets. The situation with the truck drivers has gone from conflicts and counter-pickets to solidarity. Workers have joined in solidarity and stayed outside the Ciudad Judicial where the negotiation meetings were held.\u003cbr /\u003e\nMeanwhile, almost all the union leaders not only do not support the strike but even openly attack it, like the leader of ATE Neuquén. The union leaders aligned with the Kirchner government, who went so far as to consider that it should be repressed, forcing all the sectional delegates to sign this declaration, which some of them denounced.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the position of the union leaders, on the roads and in the streets of Neuquén, there is massive participation of health workers and massive support of teachers, as well as the active support of various militant unemployed movements. In addition, most of the oil workers and truck drivers appear to be getting closer to the health workers, despite the significant physical and monetary wear and tear that being stranded on the roads causes them on a daily basis.

The \u0026#8216;Walk of Care\u0026#8217; emerged out of a series of meetings of health and care workers in Berlin. For several years now, they have been organising regular protests against shortcomings in the care sector. This year the protests were joined by midwives, physios, critical medical students and patients. Amongst other things, they demanded a general and free health service that meets the needs of the patients, a 30-hour week for health workers, and a living wage for relatives and friends who care for their next of kin.

But when the system is geared toward profit maximisation, this unfortunately gets in the way of our aims. In this case we are just supposed to restore people\u0026#8217;s labour power (meaning,  the physical and mental minimum to go to work) or, if their ability to work has been exhausted, to accompany them to death.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eAn economic system that is geared towards the maximisation of profits has no interest in caring for people: it seeks efficiency. An economic system focused on making more and more money creates jobs in which the interests of the workers are always worth less than the profit that can be made from them. Profit has always come before human lives, and we experience that very directly.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eWe experience the importance of our work for patients and the community. But we currently cannot influence the wider conditions of our labour. Nursing work increasingly takes place in an environment characterised by financial cuts, overtime, discrimination between “profitable” and “unprofitable” patients, and the exploitation of immigrant workers and women in particular. At the same time, cutbacks jeopardise psychological and social services and health care for vulnerable and highly marginalised groups in society. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eThese conditions mean that care workers, patients and people in need of care face precariousness. Staff shortages and constant work overload lead to psychological suffering, exhaustion, and fear of causing harm or making mistakes. As care workers, we experience daily that we are unable to meet our expectations and do justice to our patients. When there is hardly any time for humane care, the dehumanisation of patients is the protective reaction of many care workers. Getting through the shift is the order of the day. Often, professional nursing workers only stay in their profession for a few years after their training.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eWe must fight so that our work is not reduced to a series of interventions and measures around the sick body. Other futures are possible: community-oriented and/or self-managed care that develops ideas of health and care through its practice, based on the needs and interests of the communities with which it interacts directly. We must be prepared to challenge and resist the limitations of our roles and of the institutional structures that govern our practice. Our autonomy is important if we are to provide dignified care that is not hindered by the over-regulation and economisation of the health and care sector.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eLet us build more just and collaborative relationships. By reducing power imbalances we can improve care practice. Solidarity among colleagues is paramount: let us engage with colleagues and healthcare professionals from other specialties or settings. Dialogue between different social groups is also important: we must nurture relationships between patients, staff, friends and family in order to create a permanent state of solidarity and support in the healthcare institutions.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"\u003eThe numerous recent protest actions have shown that the system is sustained through us. Without nursing, it would not work. However, it is not enough to improve staffing. Nor is it enough to denounce the injustices of our work environment. We need to defend our interests as workers and patients. And we know that we have a better chance of asserting our interests if we join forces, form majorities and develop power through collective processes, commitments and solidarity. The time has come to enforce fundamental changes ourselves. Let us begin to fight within the care sector for a self-determined society and turn illness into a weapon.\u0026#8221;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n"}},{"node":{"title":"Issue no.1 – Against the global trauma ward!

The RAF is dropping bombs on Yemen. It\u0026#8217;s not much of a revelation to say that war is bad, but why do we think it\u0026#8217;s important to talk about it here? Do we really need more bad news about war? The truth is that, against the general narrative, war isn’t something that just affects those people miles away. Instead, the impact is felt across the whole of our society and involves all of us. Over the next 10 years, the Government has committed to spending an extra £230 billion on weapons and military equipment, while the NHS is told to tighten its belt and more and more of it are auctioned to the highest bidder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePeriods of crisis, economic or otherwise, have historically been a precursor to war. The competition over markets and territory when things get tough creates tensions between countries that inevitably boil over into conflict in a search for domination over land and labour. These conflicts are justified by calls for “patriotism” in service of the “national interest”, always only a thin veil over the call for a working class massacre. After all, it’s never the politicians who fight the wars. They leave that to us, our brothers and our sisters, the working class.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2022, after the Covid pandemic, the impacts of the war on supply chains and government finances contributed heavily to the inflation crisis that was felt across the world. In a direct way, the war was used as an excuse by governments and employers to attack the pay and conditions of workers across the world. During the strikes in the NHS, when we were pushing back against these attacks, we were accused of “serving the interests of Putin” by politicians. When faced with crises such as war, national governments double down on simplistic stories about ‘us vs them’ and ‘good vs evil’, to lean into nationalist feelings. They do this to disguise the fact that in wars between nations, the interests of workers are not the same as ‘our’ governments and corporations. They paint an imaginary picture which falls apart at the first interaction with reality. This ideology of nationalism is just a blatant attempt to create false divisions within the working class, pushing us to line up behind one group of rulers or another. This puts us in a weaker position as a class, as we give passive support to the governments to dictate to an even greater extent what happens with the resources that our class, the working class, creates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe outbreak of a hot phase of the war in Palestine has added to the general push towards war. Every day there is another warning about how this or that attack is threatening to turn the war there into a regional war. The tension between the countries reliant on Chinese dominated markets and finance on the one hand, and the US sphere of influence on the other is creating cracks in the global order. Ukraine was the first link in the chain to break, but the war in Palestine needs to be seen as another step in the same journey to barbarism and not as an isolated abnormality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the next few years, there will be more calls for war. Politicians and talking heads have been lining up to babble on about the need to bring back national service in the UK, how the UK military isn’t prepared for a war with Russia and that more money needs to be spent on buying weapons and military equipment. This might seem like a contradiction; at the same time that they are telling us that they don\u0026#8217;t have the ability to offer us anything beyond another pay cut, they are dusting off billions to pay for missiles and warplanes. In the end though it makes more sense for them to pump money into inhuman and destructive goals. There is a deep underlying economic crisis in slow motion across the world that is creating instability across the world economy, and war is a tried and tested method for governments and bosses to direct people’s anger away from the system that keeps them powerful, and toward some other group of governments and bosses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAgainst the bosses’ logic of patriotism and industrial slaughter, workers in Italy have shown what international solidarity amongst the working class can look like. Dockers in Genoa refused to load cargo to ships that they suspected to be weapons. Recently, workers in India have refused to handle any materials that they believe are bound for the Israeli state’s war with Hamas, where over 30,000 people have been slaughtered in Gaza. Historically, workers’ refusal to participate brought an end to the first world war, with massive waves of strikes in Germany and a revolution in Russia brought down the imperial war machines on both sides. We need to create the kind of organisations that resist this pull toward militarisation locally and internationally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt might seem like we’re removed from these wars; there are no bombs falling in Bristol, but they are being made in Bristol. We’re encouraged to sit quietly while our national government allows and even encourages this slide towards global war. At the same time, workers are beginning to resist this. Health workers in the UK have formed groups in solidarity with health workers in Gaza, highlighting the connections between us and our brothers and sisters elsewhere and demonstrating that our interests are not aligned with those of the bosses and the government but in our common struggle against this inhuman system that throws the bodies of thousands of workers into the meat grinder to ensure that the profit keeps flowing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe NHS is made up of workers from all over the world with common problems and issues. We need to continue to fight against the attempts to create barriers between us, whether those are religious, ethnic or national, by job role, band, profession or union. We need to do this to create an example for the wider working class that our interests are not those of the national governments or the bosses who push them, but are in fighting for a new society without exploitation of our lives and work.\u003c/p\u003e\n"}},{"node":{"title":"Paperwork nightmare – A creative way to strike by emergency services in Germany","excerpt":"\u003cp\u003eA form of labour dispute \u0026#8211; while the collective bargaining dispute was on paramedics refused to do the bureaucratic work that is necessary for the billing of services (e.g. with health insurance companies).\u003c/p\u003e\n","slug":"paperwork-nightmare-a-creative-way-to-strike-by-emergency-services-in-germany","date":"2024-05-07T14:19:28","featuredImage":{"node":{"sourceUrl":"https://vitalsignscontenteditor.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/kbl_tvoed.jpg","altText":""}},"author":{"node":{"name":"Angry Workers","firstName":"Angry","lastName":"Workers","avatar":null}},"pdf":{"pdf":null},"categories":{"edges":[{"node":{"name":"International"}}]},"tags":{"edges":[]},"content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eInterview with work council/trade union members\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e(Translated from: Express 5/2021)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a long time now, trade unions in personal services, care work, in hospitals as well as in day care centers and old people’s homes have been asking themselves the crucial question: How do you go on strike when other people depend on your work, or even when human lives depend on your own work?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt an ambulance service on the Swiss border, which is covered by the “DRK (German Red Cross) Reform Collective Agreement” negotiated between ver.di (service trade union) and DRK, the workers found a creative solution: They work, but while the collective bargaining dispute was on they refused to do the bureaucratic work that is necessary for the billing of services (e.g. with health insurance companies). Karin Zennig talked with two of the works council members involved in this “paperwork” or “billing strike”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eHow did you decide to go on paperwork strike? Why did you resort to this method and not walk out ‘normally?’\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMira: The idea came from ver.di. So far, the paperwork strike has only taken place within the emergency services. Since it is almost impossible to go on strike when you work in emergency rescue services, another method was sought to draw the employer’s attention to the grievances and to strike without suggesting to the population that human lives could be in danger. This is the best method for us. After all, we don’t want to harm the population by not manning a rescue vehicle, but to put pressure on the employer – so we work and are thus entitled to wages, but the employer doesn’t get any money from those who pay for the services. By the way, we now talk about ‘billing strike’ instead of paperwork strike, because we don’t want to give the impression that we are only ‘striking on paper’.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat are the important issues? What are you demanding?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDirk: In general, better wages, working hours and workplace arrangements. For example, it is always an issue that not all working hours are paid in the rescue service. Nationwide, it is common that for twelve hours worked, only 9.75 hours are paid. This means that every full-time employee in the rescue service works more than two hours ‘on a voluntary basis’ for every service each day. Under collective bargaining agreements, this is called ‘extended working time’ – legally, the employer thus circumvents the payment of ‘on-call time’, which would have to be considered working time according to rulings by the Federal Labor Court and the EU Court of Justice. For the first time in the 2018 collective bargaining dispute, we decided to go on a paperwork strike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eAnd how does such a ‘billing strike’ work?’ How is it different from a ‘normal strike?’ How much courage do you need to participate in a paperwork strike?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDirk: In a paperwork strike in the ambulance service, everything that concerns billing is omitted. Normally, after a rescue or emergency operation, the data of the operation (location, transport destination, crew) with the data of the patient (name, address, health insurance, etc.) are sent to the billing office. A so-called transport bill is enclosed for this purpose. This certificate confirms that the transport has been carried out and thus provides the basis for billing. However, this ‘office activity’ is not actually in the paramedic’s or ambulance crew’s original job description. To refuse to perform this activity means that insurers aren’t billed, therefore they don’t pay out, and the DRK doesn’t get reimbursed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMira: I don’t think it takes that much courage, it just takes everyone sticking together and participating. I think it would be harder to have a strike by not staffing a rescue operation than just not billing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eHow does the employer respond to that? What are their strategies?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDirk: The employers are always trying to stop industrial action with targeted intimidation. In the last but one round of collective bargaining, the employer openly communicated that in the event of a strike, payment claims against the striking workers could be expected and that everyone should think carefully about whether they would take this on themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMira: In a well-organised company, a paperwork strike like this can quickly cause tens of thousands of Euros in damage, and employers naturally don’t like that. Here it is always good and important that we know that our union is on our side and that it informs our colleagues about reaction strategies and our rights during a strike.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eEven in a paperwork strike, it’s about acting together. How do you organise the collective momentum, which gives the individual the necessary courage? How do you arrange going on strike? Who knows when they do what and why?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMira: Yes, of course everyone has to participate. There are a lot of us in the union, so that’s not a problem. We do a lot of group chats and talk to each other personally. Everyone explains to the others what it’s about and how they feel about it. And when it’s not a pandemic, we meet with our union secretary and discuss what we need and how we can move forward together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eIs this method transferable to other areas? What positive or negative experiences with the strike and the organisation or reactions have you had with it that you would like to pass on to other colleagues?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDirk: You mustn’t lose sight of the fact that this method is the most effective in bringing employers to their knees. Since workers don’t stop work, they continue to be paid in full and all other operating expenses continue as well. But the incoming flow of money is interrupted. So, it’s possible that an employer is driven into bankruptcy quite quickly. Those most responsible for strikes, like union reps or shop stewards should, if in doubt, always keep an eye on this situation and intervene in time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMira: I’m just imagining, for example, if a waiter goes on strike by bringing the food to the guest, but never issues a bill afterwards. Well, our employer was not very pleased, neither by the strike nor by the actions themselves. They’ve been used to their employees never raising their voices for years, but they have been doing so more and more often and louder and louder in recent years. In my opinion, the employers are also dealing with this in the wrong way. They make us look as if we have outrageous demands instead of finally valuing these professions more. What is very positive and resonates far and wide is the cohesion amongst us and the feeling that we can achieve something together.\u003c/p\u003e\n"}}]}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/posts/[slug]","query":{"slug":"learning-from-health-workers-in-argentina-on-the-current-rebellion-in-neuquen"},"buildId":"CrL1x7qoG-wfhW0NKG71u","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
