That is why we want to recapitulate what it has managed to do, what it has not had the strength to do, what methods it has adopted and what obstacles it has had to overcome. We appreciate the opportunity to summarize our balance sheet in a medical magazine, we want to share our experience with the medical ones.</p>\n<p>The nurses’ initiative grew out of KKN workers’ realization in January 2017 that no one would stand up for us. So far we have won for a triple pay rise in KKN from the regional operator. In addition, last summer, the hospital paid a “shift bonus” to all nurses and assistants (and to a lesser extent, to carers and paramedics). Without having to negotiate for it. We all received a ten percent increase, automatically, starting in January 2018. There was no negotiation required. We got better off, noticeably.</p>\n<p>We gained more in one year than we had in many years before. It wasn’t free on our part. We had to take a step into the unknown and rely on a long-run self-organisation and pressure from below, from the ground terrain, on the regional politicians, but most importantly on the management directly in the hospital. First of all, however, it was necessary to understand that even in the hospital, in the workplace, where we cannot strike effectively, it is possible to fight, not just negotiate. The road to that understanding was not and is not easy. It is necessary to deal with the dictates of long-established stereotypes.</p>\n<p><em>To sacrifice ourselve means to deepen the crisis</em></p>\n<p>There are many of these stereotypes, and they are ingrained in the operation of hospitals and in the health workers’ mentality. We began to untangle them when we asked the question: Why do nurses, etc. endure the devastation to their work and personal lives and to the quality of care so submissively and for so long? The answer offered itself: First and foremost, because our profession is a caring profession and we have, unfortunately, been indoctrinated that it must entail a willingness to sacrifice ourselves. But that is only the beginning of the answer.</p>\n<p>In fact, we were sometimes even proud of ourselves for managing the work for absent colleagues and other professions. Sometimes we hoped that the more we did so, the more “someone would notice” and take pity on us and compensate us. We believed that it was enough if our testimonies reached the media, the public. But the list of obstacles that stand in the way of the self-confidence of nurses and the lower healthcare staff is much longer.</p>\n<p>However, a following trap stands in the way not just to the nurses’ self-confidence for the struggle: there is a belief that those in charge, the politicians, the management, are just uninformed and therefore have no idea. However, that’s wrong, they have had their plan, their “solution” how to get through the hospital crisis, for a long time: it consists precisely in sacrificing staff, nurses and doctors, and making us endure it. This was and is their “crisis management”. Very cynical because it exploits the fact that politicians and management are not in touch with patients, their loved ones and the crisis of care on a daily basis. We are. We don’t hide in our offices.</p>\n<p>But even that’s not all, there’s still the “Become the unpaid Minister of Health” trap: when health care workers speak up, they are being asked to sort out the entire health care system. “Are you complaining that this is unbearable? Ok, so propose a different plan, preferably for the whole country,” we hear… Yes, after the n-th night shift in a row, the hospital staff should probably do the work of ministers, governors, hospital directors for free!?</p>\n<p>“My job is to put patients to sleep and wake them up, yours is to provide the money to keep the hospital running,” one of us, an anaesthesiology nurse, replied to the appeal of a regional councillor to join just another, a millionth committee. Her answer was right! It’s time to finally start from the needs of hospital staff and their patients. To put the system on its feet.</p>\n<p>But how? How to make our voices heard so that those in charge feel it, concretely, practically, in a service where we are not allowed to strike?</p>\n<p><em>To say “no” to the patching up of the service</em></p>\n<p>Last spring, KKN’s infectious disease ward was threatened with closure due to the staff shortages, and the county politicians toured the facilities in the region to lure the nurses to get a side-job by offering better rates. At the time, we urged our colleagues not to come to our infectious diseases wards to help out. It caused an uproar in the county. It was reported that “the Initiative was threatening colleagues”. However, the external nurses understood why we did not want such “help”.</p>\n<p>When KKN’s internal medicine unit was threatened with closure this January, the surgical department refused to join. Out of consideration for the internal and surgical staff and patients. And subsequently, some nurses from eleven KKN wards wrote declarations refusing to help out in the internal medicine ward. For the “privilege” of the double pay for helping out in the internal medicine, management finally managed to find two nurses from the entire hospital!</p>\n<p>To say “no” to such patching up, to refuse to participate in such faking of the service, required courage, planning, organization and great responsibility. However, it was the understanding that it was such patching up and fiddling that brought the hospital, and not only ours, to its present state. Overpaying nurses from other departments and from outside the hospital, not following adaptation processes, forcing staff to go beyond their competencies and job descriptions… These are the ways of not solving the crisis, but prolonging it. If the managers and politicians refuse to take responsibility, the workers have to.</p>\n<p><em>It’s about working conditions, not just the money</em></p>\n<p>We have not opened the balance sheet by listing what we have achieved in terms of wages for the sake of boasting. After all, we did not achieve our demand for the introduction of national pay grades in the KKN. Regarding the pay grades, politicians, led by the regional governor Jana Vildumetzová and the councillor Jan Bures, as well as the management of the hospital director Jitka Samáková, deceived us for many months with promises that were only meant to calm down the KKN staff. When the time came to meet the promises, they ran away from them. We do not forget this. Nor do we forget that the state is increasing wages by 10 per cent in our sector, which has long been underfunded, in a situation where wages, and therefore competition, are rising throughout the labour market.</p>\n<p>In taking stock of our experience, we wanted to move from the obvious to the harder but more important issues. We started with money to emphasise that it is not just about money. It is not a sensible choice to accept the devastation of one’s own profession and life, the decline of patient care, the deterioration of working conditions in exchange for more money.</p>\n<p>It is all about refusing to cooperate with management and politicians in their gambling with care, in their trampling on the profession, in devastating the working and living conditions of the staff, nurses and doctors. The big “no’s”, of which we at KKN have only been able to say “a few” through much of the hospital, are obvious. But it is the small “no’s” on the ground in the workplaces which really matter: to refuse to do the work instead of another profession (important, but not my job!), to insist on having a break or its reimbursement, to refuse to exceed the workload, that my superiors force me to do because of the staffing crisis and thus risk legal action against me, to refuse to have a staff “reinforcement” assigned to the ward, who as a non-nurse is supposed to do the nurse’s work and for whose misconduct I will then be responsible…</p>\n<p>Such “small” but immediate “no’s” will get inscribed into the self-esteem of the staff. They have the power to change the practices of the service. They require individual courage, collective intelligence and co-operation. They are the “no’s” of breaking the rules. It is a method of struggle how to push, step by step, from below, from the practice, for a solution. How to create, through our own responsibility (for our own health and our lives, and for the health and lives of the patients), a situation in which politicians and managers can no longer run away from their responsibilities. To ensure that the impact of us sticking to the rulebook will reach from the bottom of the hospital, through the middle ranks, up to the top levels and above the hospital, to the national level.</p>\n<p>We are very grateful for the opportunity to look back on our year and a half in this medical journal. For many reasons. Because we share a workplace with the doctors. Because it is good to exchange experiences of fighting for better money, conditions and greater professional pride, which the crisis in hospitals is taking away from us (after all, it was from the experience of the doctors’ movement “Thank you, we are leaving” that we started to organize). Because the better working conditions the doctors and nurses have, the easier it will be to work together.</p>\n<p>The nurses’ initiative</p>\n<p>organizujemese.cz</p>\n<p>———</p>\n<p><strong>Two leaflets from the Initiative</strong></p>\n<p><em>Experience from practice: how we fight in our department</em></p>\n<p>Even a “small” rebellion on the ward is the beginning of a journey towards self-confidence. The following “NO” (“NO” to regulations’ violations) experiences are proof of this. They may seem “trivial”, but at KKN they have actually opened the way for other “NOs”, they inspired and gave courage. They set an example. And in the end, with other “NOs” from other departments, they created a collective force and generated pressure. And from the other side – they required courage to start, to hold the line and act as an organized collective.</p>\n<p>Our experience is from the central operating theatres: we agreed collectively that we did not want to refuse overtime work (each of us had her own reasons). Therefore, we were looking for another way how to put the management under pressure.</p>\n<p>The very first thing was the observance of lunch breaks. As simple as it sounds, even that was a fight. Following the Labour Code, we began to take our lunch break at peace, no later than 1pm. We had to break their resistance to get that.</p>\n<p>The next step was to comply with the standards when admitting and handing over the patients: from now on, nice and easy, with regard for the patient, not at mad speed. Not as before in a rush and with an often stressed out patient on the operating table.</p>\n<p>Then we looked around for what other regulations say. Hygiene, for example. These, for example, impose an exposure time for each disinfection (but we can call it a “mopping break” because that’s what the term means :)). So? So, after wiping, we began to wait for 15 minutes, as our disinfection rules require. Only then we moved on to the next patient. Sure, it may sound boring, too basic, but what a fight was it! “Who do you think you are?” “How dare you to slow down the procedural order?”</p>\n<p>All these little steps, one after another, led to a general outrage. It took a long time to get them accepted even by those who should have followed them in the first place.</p>\n<p>And what has it given to us? Many gains, in every respect. For example, we don’t slip on wet floors anymore, we don’t breathe in the fumes of disinfectant solutions (there are studies on the harm of inhaling these fumes over a long period of time), operating rooms are disinfected as they should be. We eat lunch around noon like humans. We don’t rush around as we used to. Patients benefit from our approach.</p>\n<p>But it has brought out something extra, something that actually reaches beyond our department. Someone may believe that these are just some small things (but those who deal with such things know that changing them is not an easy ride). But when more and more departments start to change the existing, established way of working on similar “little things”, when the amount of those little things grows and grows, many little flames will turn into fires. And gradually they will burn their way up to management. And yes, eventually management will realize that the old ways just don’t cut it. That we need to bring in new nurses. That there is no other option – that it just can’t and never will be done without nurses.</p>\n<p>Each department has its own specifics, its own procedures. But working conditions can be improved everywhere. This is for a longer conversation. Everywhere you can “use a lever” to change the stereotypes (and the given awareness of nurses). It just needs taking a distance from the learned, from the automated. These are all steps that are consistent with the standards, regulations, the Labour code. They are all by the book. No one can accuse us of doing something wrong, let alone punish us for it.</p>\n<p>Of course, many of us have been targeted by colleagues who, from a position of power, thought they could bring us back to the “obedience”. We stood our ground. And we will continue to fight in this way. Firstly, because although the leadership in KKN promised us the national pay grades, they have not kept their promise – and we do not want to work with someone who does not keep their promises. And secondly, because we aim to straighten our professional pride and working conditions for good.</p>\n<p>Finally, I would like to say that it is sad that we as health professionals have to use sticking to the Labour code as a threat. After all, it should be the alpha and omega. That is why it must be emphasised: the entire health sector today is based on non-compliance with the Labour Code, and those responsible are ignoring this dangerous fact.</p>\n<p>It is up to us to change this.</p>\n<p>———</p>\n<p><em>How to seek a pay rise in your hospital</em></p>\n<p>Union negotiations with the government are unlikely to yield even 10% pay rise. In any case, they will guarantee less than a quarter of a percent pay rise to the staff in private health care. They have been thrown over the board. However, they (but not only them) have a chance to gain more. Hospitals will get a record amount of money from the government through the compensation scheme. Now the point is to force our managements to spend these money on wages. To give it to the people who keep the health care afloat. To those to who the management owes a lot. To those who are paying for the staffing crisis without having had caused it. To give it to the staff – nurses, assistants, carers, paramedics, doctors, cleaners.</p>\n<p>To force the management… Does it seem mission impossible? It’s not impossible. We have a proof, an example, that it can be done. The first issue of our paper will be about how to do just that.</p>\n<p>Yes, we can! An example from the Karlovy Vary Regional Hospital (KKN)</p>\n<p>Three pay rises in one year, which also meant that some of the nursing categories in the joint-stock company get better basic pay than according to the national state pay grades. Shift allowance from summer 2017 for all nurses, not just those on shifts, and to a lesser extent for others, nursing assistants and paramedics. As of January 2018, the national 10 percent rise. Better working conditions on the militant wards. And above all: more self-confidence in relation to the management.</p>\n<p>This is the result of the struggle that began in February 2017 at KKN. Yet, as recently as December 2016, no one there could have imagined that such a thing was possible. At the beginning, there were several female colleagues. Gradually, the initiative grew into a self-organisation, a force that was able to put a lot of pressure on the regional government and on the leadership.</p>\n<p>The Initiative made it in KKN also because it understood the following:</p>\n<p>Staff must stand up for themselves. Poor pay and conditions are also the result of relying on “someone to sort it out for us” (unions, media, politicians, labour inspections…).</p>\n<p>The strength is in the departments uniting from below. In practice, this meant mapping and comparing workplace conditions, our own meetings (outside working time), producing a newspaper, setting up different whatsapp and email groups…</p>\n<p>→ We need to have the basics of self-organisation before we start talking to management. Not the other way around.</p>\n<p>The strength is in the struggle, not in negotiations! Our potential strength (read on to see what it may look like) is in the hospital, in the terrain, in the wards, on the job, not in the office at a negotiating table.</p>\n<p>→ The principle is: as much direct pressure as possible from the bottom of the ward first, negotiation afterwards and as little as possible.</p>\n<p>We don’t care where the employer will find the money for higher wages. “We don’t have the money for wages”, “we are in debt” are the first answers we hear. In KKN, the nurses said, “You – the politicians and management – don’t care where we find the money to pay our bills from our miserable wages, or who is looking after our kids when we are doing the n-th shift in a row… We, in turn, don’t care where you get the money for higher wages.”</p>\n<p>→ Let’s not get sucked into the responsibility of “finding resources”. We’re nurses, assistants, carers, paramedics, we’re not managers – that’s their job. Let’s not get sucked into the task forces and endless meetings.</p>\n<p>The struggle, the pressure, must be based on the conditions in specific wards. Perhaps in every hospital, in every ward, operations are “patched up” with overtime beyond the legal mandatory limit, with violations of regulations, job descriptions, standards… If we say “NO” to this, management will have to back down.</p>\n<p>→ There is no single method of fighting. It has to fit the workplace. But the fight must be coordinated.</p>\n<p>We need to be radical and patient. It’s not just a fight with management. It’s also a fight with passivity, obedience, the mentality of “don’t get yourself into a trouble…” and “the negotiation is still on, just be patient and see how it turns out, the fight is not appropriate at the moment…”. All of this has intoxicated our departments for years. It’s taken its toll on us. It’s a long haul to change that.</p>\n<p>There are many more lessons to be learned. These are the most basic. Others will be spelled out in the future issues of the paper. And you yourselves will discover yet other lessons as soon as you will you launch yourselves into building self-organization and struggle (with us).

But they have found ways to make themselves heard. Read more about this below. If you are interested in discussing our situation as health workers and the current pay campaign, get in touch: vitalsignsmag@proton.me</em></p>\n<p>What started as a health workers’ dispute has turned into a regional uprising. Since early March, health workers throughout the province of Neuquén in Argentina have been staging unofficial strikes and roadblocks, demanding a pay rise higher than the miserable deal agreed by the government and the unions. They also demanding better working conditions to face what is expected to be the second wave of coronavirus in Argentina. The health system is not up to the task. Increased layoffs of critical care nurses and emergency paramedics over the past year have exacerbated staffing shortages. This dispute has turned into a bigger movement, and a self-organised one at that. Workers have been setting up a strike fund and holding open meetings at the hospital entrances. After being ignored, the movement has escalated their tactics by using roadblocks to obstruct the province’s oil and gas production.</p>\n<div class=\"wordads-ad-wrapper\">\n<div id=\"atatags-26942-851726\" data-adtags-width=\"740\"><strong>Background of the dispute</strong></div>\n</div>\n<p>In December 2019, the provincial government froze public sector wages. This meant a 26% loss of purchasing power for health sector workers in the midst of the 2020 pandemic. The vaccination campaign, which began in early 2021, is slow to get off the ground while Argentina is caught up in the second wave of the pandemic.</p>\n<p><strong>Why has it kicked off now?</strong></p>\n<p>On February 24th this year, the provincial government offered a 12% wage increase to health workers. On February 25th, the union’s grassroots assemblies in about 20 hospitals and health centres rejected this proposal. Union General Secretary Carlos Quintriqueo ignored this vote, and on Feb. 26th, the union leadership accepted the government’s deal. This fierce betrayal of union (ATE) representatives was the straw that broke the camel’s back.</p>\n<p>On March 2nd, a large inter-hospital meeting of health workers was held in the centre of Neuquén, the provincial capital. They decided to demand that wage negotiations be resumed, a 40% increase for 2020 and an adjustment in line with inflation for 2021. They also decided to coordinate their demands with the teachers’ union, ATEN, and to draw up a joint action plan. ATEN had rejected the same wage proposal a few days earlier, and decided not to resume classes on March 3rd.</p>\n<p>At the same time, various conflicts were spreading in the region. Social movements blocked rural road bridges and other points for an increase in support programs; schools throughout the province made demands of the state; and the feminist movement took to the streets against the femicide of Guadalupe Curual in Villa La Angostura. On March 10th, self-organized health workers, opposition to the ATEN union leadership, other public sector workers, workers in the self-managed tile factories, and social movements came together in a demonstration that ended at the main government building. On March 12th, health workers with the union of justice workers (SEJUN) blocked the bridges between Neuquén and Cipolletti. Meanwhile, ATEN maintained a protest camp in front of the government building. There was still no response from the political side.</p>\n<p>On March 16th, the provincial government agreed to add 3% to the wage increase, for a total of 15%. At the same time, the health workers rehearsed a first blockade of the oil route, the roads through which the project of Vaca Muerta is carried out. (Vaca Muerta is an oil shale deposit where they’re fracking). The government continued to refuse to meet with the self-organized workers. ATEN’s union leadership pushed through the approval of the wage proposal, even though it meant a significant loss of wages. On the same day, the Cerámica Neuquén tile factory (which had been taken over by the workers*) was again threatened with eviction and auction.</p>\n<p>On March 24th, (the anniversary of the 1976 coup), thousands again took to the streets. In addition to the usual demands for commemoration, truth and justice, health was big on peoples’ agenda, demonstrating the broad legitimacy health workers now had amongst the wider population. More roadblocks, this time to famous tourist destinations, resulted in more clashes. The traffic chaos and growing criticism of a continued lack of response from the government emboldened health sector workers to expand their struggle further.</p>\n<div class=\"wordads-ad-wrapper\">\n<div id=\"atatags-26942-551511\" data-adtags-width=\"740\"><strong>Oil and gas blockades</strong></div>\n</div>\n<p>The Neuquén area is known for its oil and gas industry. On April 7th, a series of indefinite blockades began at strategic points along the oil route, focussing on Añelo, the neuralgic centre of Vaca Muerta. Through the roadblocks, workers have been mainly targeting the trucks transporting fuel from the Vaca Muerta refinery, while letting the rest of the drivers pass. The blockades have made it difficult to drill new wells, forcing the closure of smaller wells, and causing problems at processing plants that threaten Buenos Aires’ gas supply.</p>\n<p>As the government continued its silence, the number of blockades increased to twelve by April 10th. For the last two weeks, 30 roadblocks have paralysed the activities of the petroleum industry in Vaca Muerta.</p>\n<p>In parallel, a meeting was convened with social movements, unions, parties and local organizations in the city of Neuquén at the Castro Rendón Hospital, the largest hospital in the province. A few hours after this meeting, the state energy company of the province, EPEN, cut off the electricity to the worker-run Zanon-FaSinPat tile factory.</p>\n<p>At first, the authorities had maintained that pay rise negotiations would only take place with the unions and refused to meet with the strikers. Finally, after weeks of unofficial actions, the provincial government agreed to meet the protestors but after a couple of meetings, which the workers considered unproductive and a waste of their time, they decided to leave the negotiation table until there was an acceptable pay rise proposal from the government.</p>\n<p><em>“We left our answer on the table and told them that we are not going to accept any more teasing, as they did yesterday (Friday 16th) when they kept us for 9 hours in sterile discussions. When they have a proposal for an increase in the basic pay, they can call us and we will sit down to discuss it. In the meantime we will continue to hold roadblocks and deepen the measures.”</em> said one of the representatives of the workers, after last Saturday’s meeting.</p>\n<p>Throughout all this, the Mapuche communities in the Añelo area have been joining the pickets. The situation with the truck drivers has gone from conflicts and counter-pickets to solidarity. Workers have joined in solidarity and stayed outside the Ciudad Judicial where the negotiation meetings were held.<br />\nMeanwhile, almost all the union leaders not only do not support the strike but even openly attack it, like the leader of ATE Neuquén. The union leaders aligned with the Kirchner government, who went so far as to consider that it should be repressed, forcing all the sectional delegates to sign this declaration, which some of them denounced.</p>\n<p>Despite the position of the union leaders, on the roads and in the streets of Neuquén, there is massive participation of health workers and massive support of teachers, as well as the active support of various militant unemployed movements. In addition, most of the oil workers and truck drivers appear to be getting closer to the health workers, despite the significant physical and monetary wear and tear that being stranded on the roads causes them on a daily basis. Some helped to block supply products for fracking, and have been maintaining food supplies.</p>\n<p>Last week ended with a strike by the teachers’ union ATEN and the judiciary union SEJUN, which issued a joint statement with various unions at the Universidad del Comahue. It was a strike in solidarity with the health sector. The union leaders, under pressure from their own rank and file and large public support, could no longer stay out of it.</p>\n<div class=\"wordads-ad-wrapper\">\n<div id=\"atatags-26942-963534\" data-adtags-width=\"740\">In a recent statement, the workers declared that: <em>¨(…) In the face of any offer from the government, it will be the assemblies of the hospitals and health centres, including the comrades who are on the different picket lines on the routes, who will decide whether to accept or reject it. If our rebellion was because a group of leaders decided on a miserable increase behind our backs, it will continue to be the rank and file who will decide the next steps. We call on the workers in each hospital and health centre to continue fighting for our decent pay and working conditions to continue in the front line of care for the population in this pandemic and the community to continue to support us.¨</em></div>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Effects of the uprising so far… </strong></p>\n<p>The management tried to get oil workers to denounce health workers. Without success. The contractors complain about losses of millions. But the health workers’ struggle has also revealed that oil companies are raking in millions in profits every day. Another success of the ‘elephants’ (that’s what the health workers call their movement).</p>\n<p><em>“We work in conditions of overwork and overtiredness. We’ve had to maintain daily operations, with a lack of materials and rudimentary equipment.” Since early March 2021, the staff of the Centenario Hospital in the Argentine city of Neuquén has been on strike against planned austerity measures. The women are at the forefront of this. They are fighting against deteriorating working conditions and trying to make up for the loss of childcare in the pandemic.

Why did you resort to this method and not walk out ‘normally?’</em></p>\n<p>Mira: The idea came from ver.di. So far, the paperwork strike has only taken place within the emergency services. Since it is almost impossible to go on strike when you work in emergency rescue services, another method was sought to draw the employer’s attention to the grievances and to strike without suggesting to the population that human lives could be in danger. This is the best method for us. After all, we don’t want to harm the population by not manning a rescue vehicle, but to put pressure on the employer – so we work and are thus entitled to wages, but the employer doesn’t get any money from those who pay for the services. By the way, we now talk about ‘billing strike’ instead of paperwork strike, because we don’t want to give the impression that we are only ‘striking on paper’.</p>\n<p><em>What are the important issues? What are you demanding?</em></p>\n<p>Dirk: In general, better wages, working hours and workplace arrangements. For example, it is always an issue that not all working hours are paid in the rescue service. Nationwide, it is common that for twelve hours worked, only 9.75 hours are paid. This means that every full-time employee in the rescue service works more than two hours ‘on a voluntary basis’ for every service each day. Under collective bargaining agreements, this is called ‘extended working time’ – legally, the employer thus circumvents the payment of ‘on-call time’, which would have to be considered working time according to rulings by the Federal Labor Court and the EU Court of Justice. For the first time in the 2018 collective bargaining dispute, we decided to go on a paperwork strike.</p>\n<p><em>And how does such a ‘billing strike’ work?’ How is it different from a ‘normal strike?’ How much courage do you need to participate in a paperwork strike?</em></p>\n<p>Dirk: In a paperwork strike in the ambulance service, everything that concerns billing is omitted. Normally, after a rescue or emergency operation, the data of the operation (location, transport destination, crew) with the data of the patient (name, address, health insurance, etc.) are sent to the billing office. A so-called transport bill is enclosed for this purpose. This certificate confirms that the transport has been carried out and thus provides the basis for billing. However, this ‘office activity’ is not actually in the paramedic’s or ambulance crew’s original job description. To refuse to perform this activity means that insurers aren’t billed, therefore they don’t pay out, and the DRK doesn’t get reimbursed.</p>\n<p>Mira: I don’t think it takes that much courage, it just takes everyone sticking together and participating. I think it would be harder to have a strike by not staffing a rescue operation than just not billing.</p>\n<p><em>How does the employer respond to that? What are their strategies?</em></p>\n<p>Dirk: The employers are always trying to stop industrial action with targeted intimidation. In the last but one round of collective bargaining, the employer openly communicated that in the event of a strike, payment claims against the striking workers could be expected and that everyone should think carefully about whether they would take this on themselves.</p>\n<p>Mira: In a well-organised company, a paperwork strike like this can quickly cause tens of thousands of Euros in damage, and employers naturally don’t like that. Here it is always good and important that we know that our union is on our side and that it informs our colleagues about reaction strategies and our rights during a strike.</p>\n<p><em>Even in a paperwork strike, it’s about acting together. How do you organise the collective momentum, which gives the individual the necessary courage? How do you arrange going on strike? Who knows when they do what and why?</em></p>\n<p>Mira: Yes, of course everyone has to participate. There are a lot of us in the union, so that’s not a problem. We do a lot of group chats and talk to each other personally. Everyone explains to the others what it’s about and how they feel about it. And when it’s not a pandemic, we meet with our union secretary and discuss what we need and how we can move forward together.</p>\n<p><em>Is this method transferable to other areas? What positive or negative experiences with the strike and the organisation or reactions have you had with it that you would like to pass on to other colleagues?</em></p>\n<p>Dirk: You mustn’t lose sight of the fact that this method is the most effective in bringing employers to their knees. Since workers don’t stop work, they continue to be paid in full and all other operating expenses continue as well. But the incoming flow of money is interrupted. So, it’s possible that an employer is driven into bankruptcy quite quickly. Those most responsible for strikes, like union reps or shop stewards should, if in doubt, always keep an eye on this situation and intervene in time.</p>\n<p>Mira: I’m just imagining, for example, if a waiter goes on strike by bringing the food to the guest, but never issues a bill afterwards. Well, our employer was not very pleased, neither by the strike nor by the actions themselves. They’ve been used to their employees never raising their voices for years, but they have been doing so more and more often and louder and louder in recent years. In my opinion, the employers are also dealing with this in the wrong way. They make us look as if we have outrageous demands instead of finally valuing these professions more. What is very positive and resonates far and wide is the cohesion amongst us and the feeling that we can achieve something together.</p>\n"}},{"node":{"title":"“We don’t need applause, we need change!” – Interview with a striking nurse in Berlin","excerpt":"<p>On the 23rd of August 2021, workers of the Berlin hospitals Charité and Vivantes went on a three-day warning strike.

In the near future we will try to write up further thoughts on the Berlin hospital strike, including a critical reflection on the trade union strategy, based on conversations with local health workers. You can read this article to understand the wider context. Despite various limitations, e.g. a strike participation of only around 20% (also due to legal emergency cover), we can still learn a lot from our fellow workers in Berlin – in preparation for future disputes here in the health sector in the UK.</em></p>\n<p><em>Original article <a href=\"https://communaut.org/de/wir-brauchen-keinen-applaus-sondern-veraenderung\">here</a></em></p>\n<p>——</p>\n<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>\n<p>On the 23rd of August 2021, workers of the Berlin hospitals Charité and Vivantes went on a three-day warning strike. The strike included the outsourced service workers at Vivantes. This was preceded by an ultimatum of 100 days, which the Berlin Hospital Movement (an alliance of initiatives and unions) had issued to the Senate (local government) and the employers of the state-owned hospitals on the 12th of May. The trade union demanded a serious offer concerning staffing levels, so-called ‘relief’, and pay and conditions according to the collective agreement for the public sector (TVöD) for all employees of the outsourced subsidiaries. The Senate and employers let the time pass unused – the health workers made good on their announcement and went on strike. Vivantes initially had the walkout banned by a temporary injunction from the labour court. The reason given: The medical care of patients was not secured because no emergency service agreement had been settled between Vivantes and Ver.di (the responsible trade union) in the run-up to the strike. However, the injunction was overturned a short time later at the labour court, and the walkout at Vivantes could begin.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, it is clear that the strikes will continue. Today (6th of September 2021) Ver.di published the results of a strike ballot: about 98% of the union members at Charité and Vivantes voted for further work stoppages.</p>\n<p>These latest disputes continue a long-standing movement for more staff and relief at the hospitals. The struggles at Charité played a pioneering role in this (for the history, see the Ver.di brochure “If there are more of us it is better for all”). Following on from the Berlin experience, a movement for a collective ‘relief’ contract, which would allow for better staffing ratios, also formed in the region of Saarland from 2017 onwards. In these movements, strikes were held on the basis of emergency service agreements in which the employer was given responsibility for patient safety. Another novelty was the model of ‘collective bargaining advisors’ or team delegates. These delegates, which are supposed to be in close contact with the team nature of day-to-day work, should create a strong feedback loop between the collective bargaining process and the ran-and-file on the shop-floor.</p>\n<p>We talked with Anja Voigt about the latest struggles. Anja is an intensive care nurse at Vivantes, involved in the Berlin alliance “Health not Profits”, Ver.di member and part of the collective bargaining commission.</p>\n<p>———</p>\n<p><em>Communaut: Before you went on strike, you gave the senate and the employers a hundred-day ultimatum so that they would make you an offer for a collective agreements. Since there was no movement at all on their part, you now went on a three-day warning strike. How did you decide to use the ultimatum as a means of struggle?</em></p>\n<p>Our thought behind it was that the time was ripe for a renewed fight, since nursing and the hospital have received a certain amount of public attention through Corona. In addition, in September there is the election for the House of Representatives in Berlin. So the months from May to September were a good timeline to put pressure on politicians. If we simply stood up and demanded a collective agreement on relief, probably no one would have noticed. That’s why we tied the demand for a new collective agreement to an ultimatum, saying, “If serious negotiations don’t start by the end of the ultimatum, we’re going on strike.”</p>\n<p><em>Did the idea of the ultimatum come more from the union side or from the workers?</em></p>\n<p>The idea came more from the union, but really only the idea. A lot of colleagues were involved in the whole implementation, who in turn asked their colleagues: “Do we want to do this? Is this something that can bring us success?” The idea alone would not have been enough. When we asked our colleagues if they would take part in industrial action, they were beating down our doors. They were really up for it. The pressure on health workers is now so great and it’s clear to everyone that things can’t go on like this in Berlin’s hospitals.</p>\n<p><em>Does that mean that there is currently a high level of support for the demands and a high level of participation in the strike?</em></p>\n<p>Yes, there is a very high level of support. We started with a petition to find out whether our colleagues wanted to take part and whether the demands were important to them. More than 8,500 colleagues signed the petition. The approval of the demands for relief (better staffing levels) was also clear in the last TvöD (collective contract for the public sector) negotiations in October, when Ver.di asked what we would like to see negotiated. It emerged that many colleagues are no longer interested in a pay increase, but in more staff. More money is nice, of course, but it doesn’t solve the current problems. On the contrary, the current workload is causing more and more people to leave the nursing profession. In order to stop this, fundamental changes must finally be made.</p>\n<p><em>How do you organise yourselves on the hospital level and, above all, between the various hospitals?</em></p>\n<p>Initially I was unsure if a simultaneous struggle in two hospitals would work. I had doubts about whether it could work. Vivantes alone has nine different locations, the hospital campus is vast, while Charité has three large complexes. Nevertheless, we wanted to bundle our demands and develop a joint movement. I have to say, it’s working brilliantly. Social media are wonderful for such purposes, especially telegram channels, etc. We are much better networked today than we were during the collective bargaining disputes two years ago, which is really impressive. I suddenly know colleagues from the Benjamin Franklin Hospital or from Spandau with whom I had never been in contact before. Now we know each other and are aware of each other’s problems. The greater networking also leads to enormous cohesion between the colleagues, which of course also makes us stronger. I haven’t experienced that in recent years – and I’ve really been active in the union for a long time. A really strong movement has emerged. You can also see this in the fact that – albeit slowly – small success are becoming visible. We can move a lot due to the size that we have now.</p>\n<p><em>Is your networking ‘only’ digital or do you also meet in person?</em></p>\n<p>Of course we also meet in person. That’s very important for the exchange of ideas. But it’s striking how much easier communication has become thanks to social media: In the past, if there was something important to communicate that affected everyone, in the worst case we would write a newsletter. It would then be on the road for half a week until it reached the last area. Some people didn’t receive the information until 14 days later. Today, you send something to the telegram group and 5,000 people know about it immediately, which is a great relief and makes union work much more interesting for me, because you can reach so many people so quickly. That’s really fun.</p>\n<p><em>How did you come up with your demands, is it more top-down? Are they Ver.di demands or do they come from below through your networking?</em></p>\n<p>No, it’s not top-down at all, quite the opposite, it starts at the bottom. We have started – very laboriously – to talk to every single colleague. In their teams and on their wards, colleagues asked other colleagues. In this way, each colleague conducted a so-called demand interview, in which they were asked what their work situation was like, what was stressing them, what was needed to improve the situation, what was needed to reduce the workload, and how many staff would be needed to do a good job and to be able to care for patients well. We then gradually bundled the demands that were mentioned in the hundreds of interviews and used them to draw up systematic demands. Nothing was dictated from above.</p>\n<p><em>For some years now, Ver.di has had a system of team delegates for labour disputes, here in Berlin and beyond. Can you describe how this works? Do workers have more of a say vis-à-vis the union leadership than before? How do you see the relationship between union activists and Ver.di in general? Ver.di has not always covered itself with glory in the past – for example, during the Charité strike.</em></p>\n<p>This is now a very broad and democratic process. What I have just described with regard to the demands also applies to the feedback from the other side. You can think of it roughly like this: A ward has about one to three team delegates, depending on its size. On the one hand, these team delegates maintain the connection to the collective bargaining commission, i.e. directly to the main Ver.di office, and on the other hand they feed all the information back to their team. It is no longer just one person from each hospital building who sits on the collective bargaining committee and has to establish a flow of information to the entire workforce, but there is now a direct link between ward teams and the main office. For example, we have a meeting of the collective bargaining committee today and afterwards, at 5 p.m., there is a Zoom meeting with all team delegates from Vivantes and Charité. We then report to everyone what happened today and what we have planned. The team delegates then have the opportunity to give us feedback. So it’s not just a one-sided address from us and then the meeting is over. If the team delegates say they don’t agree with what we agreed to in the bargaining committee, then we don’t do that either. We don’t even make important decisions without this feedback.</p>\n<p>This system of team delegates makes a lot of the female colleagues feel more involved. They no longer have the feeling: “Now we’re back to collective bargaining and Ver.di will say what’s going to happen, and then we’ll stand there with a flag and go on a warning strike and it’ll be fine.” Instead, they have the feeling that what is important to them also reaches the union and is negotiated directly. It’s about their needs and the needs of their patients on the ward. That’s what makes this movement so special.</p>\n<p><em>You are currently fighting two battles at Vivantes at the same time: On the one hand, the nursing staff fights for the collective ‘relief’ agreement. On the other hand, the outsourced workers of the Vivantes subsidiaries fight for the integration into the collective agreement for the public sector (TVöD). How did you manage to combine the two struggles? That’s sometimes a difficult thing to do.</em></p>\n<p>Yes, that’s incredibly difficult, especially to make sure that the struggle remains simultaneous. But it was important to us from the very beginning to make clear that we are one hospital and that everyone in this hospital works together. That’s teamwork. The nurse is no better than the cleaner, the handyman or maintenance person no less important than the radiographer. Only together can we provide good patient care. It’s really special that we’ve managed to bring so many people with different demands along with us. At the moment, the nursing staff is fighting for a collective agreement to reduce the workload, the subsidiary workers would finally like to be paid fairly, and yet we are fighting together. We also hold joint collective bargaining committee meetings and exchange information together digitally. When the management of the subsidiary company comes up with a new offer to negotiate, we are invited to join in and discuss it: “You want to go on strike now, it doesn’t really suit us right now, but we can support you.” That’s always a very productive exchange. I find it very inspiring. It creates a close cohesion within the hospital. Suddenly you say hello to the cleaning staff early in the morning, who you didn’t even notice before. I also find it impressive that at the strike demonstration last week, colleagues spontaneously took to the stage and spoke in front of 1,000 people who no one else would have noticed. All of a sudden they are visible in their function and position.</p>\n<p><em>Can you assess how the willingness to fight has changed as a result of Corona? Have you noticed any changes compared to before?</em></p>\n<p>This bad situation in the hospitals existed before Corona, of course, but it has become even worse, the workload has increased further. In addition, there is the factor that I mentioned earlier: We got more attention and publicity because of Corona. It makes the fight easier when you know that many people and the general public are behind us. I also believe that the willingness to fight has increased again as a result of the stupid applause. Many of us felt fooled by it and now say, “You can stop the nonsense, we really want a change now and now we’re going to do something.”</p>\n<p><em>At the Charité, and also at other public hospitals, the strikes of the past years were based on the regulation of a so-called emergency service agreement. This plays a relatively important role in the enforcement and organisation of strikes in hospitals, and in your case there has even been a court case. Can you explain what exactly an emergency service agreement is and how it comes about?</em></p>\n<p>The concept of the emergency service agreement was first developed during the big Charité strike in 2015. Until then, there were virtually no strikes in hospitals. Maybe people from reception occasionally engaged in symbolic pickets but otherwise it was always said: “We can’t go on strike because our patients won’t be cared for.” This led to great frustration among hospital workers. As a result, the union at the Charité came up with the emergency service agreement system. With this agreement, the union gives the employer sufficient notice that they want to strike. The employer is then responsible for ensuring patient care. To put it bluntly, the emergency service agreement says to the employer: “We won’t be on the ward tomorrow morning, so make sure that there are fewer patients.” This makes it possible to delegate responsibility to the employer, which is why this emergency service agreement is so important. In the meantime, hundreds of such agreements have been concluded in many hospitals in Germany. In the meantime, however, it is no longer quite so easy to enforce. In the past, it was a matter of settling an emergency service agreement for three warning strike days. Today, and especially in Berlin, we are no longer talking about just three days. The employer also knows that and naturally says, “No, not with us.” It is no longer enough to simply indicate that we will walk out. There are now negotiations back and forth and in the end the employers don’t want to settle for an emergency service agreement. But then we go on strike anyway because it’s our right and we have an emergency service agreement in place that we abide by. This means that our patients are not at risk. This has now also been confirmed to us in court in the current dispute.</p>\n<p><em>At the beginning of this warning strike, Vivantes first managed to enforce a ban on strikes by means of a temporary injunction. What would you say was the strategy behind that?</em></p>\n<p>The employer’s strategy was quite simply to prevent the strike. But it didn’t work; on the contrary, it backfired for Vivantes. During those three days, the willingness to fight grew even more because people were angry. The employer shot themselves in the foot, and I don’t think they expected this. We were proven right. It was also very important to many colleagues that we were not deprived of our basic rights just because we work in a hospital, but that it is clear that you can also strike responsibly in a hospital. It also annoys me in the public debate when people act as if we were irresponsible. None of my colleagues walks out, drops everything and we’re gone. We always check to see if someone else is there to do the necessary work. And we agree: “If you stay, I’ll go out, tomorrow we’ll do it the other way around.” That goes without saying. We took on so much responsibility in the Corona crisis, we didn’t run away. Of course, we won’t do the same in the event of a strike.</p>\n<p><em>When the strike at Vivantes was hanging in the balance, did you discuss among yourselves what you would do to get around it if the strike ban remained in place?</em></p>\n<p>The first moment the order was announced, we were all shocked. Then we quickly regrouped and thought about what we would do now. It was clear to us very quickly that Vivantes would not be able to get this emergency injunction through. A judge had decided that in a rush, but we knew that we had a good emergency service agreement and that we would get justice in court. And with this conviction that we would win, we went to court and won.</p>\n<p><em>The managing director of Vivantes, Johannes Danckert, likes to emphasise that he is also in favour of relief agreements, but that one hospital alone can’t do anything and that more money and, above all, political solutions are needed at the state or federal level. How would you answer him?</em></p>\n<p>I would tell him that he is absolutely right. The hospital financing system urgently needs to be reformed. Political solutions are needed, no question about it. We’re all with him on that, and we’ll also join him in the streets to demonstrate for that. But in the current situation, it’s up to Berlin’s state politicians, and we’re putting just as much pressure on them as we are on the management. We are always told by the management that they can’t decide anything and that the money has to come from politics. But we talk to them just as we talk to our management. As a city, as the capital of the Federal Republic of Germany, we have to think about whether we want to provide good services of general interest, healthcare that is fair to everyone, patients and employees alike. If you want that, then you have to spend money on it.</p>\n<p><em>Now there is an emergency service agreement. How many employees were ultimately able to take part in the warning strikes and demonstrations?</em></p>\n<p>There were 2,000 people at the strike demonstration on Wednesday. That was very impressive. There is still no emergency service agreement that Vivantes would have accepted. There is one that we say is good, that the employer could sign at any time – but they don’t, although it has also been confirmed in court. Nevertheless, many colleagues can go on strike with this emergency service agreement. I can’t give exact figures now, but certainly half of the colleagues were able to take part in the strike.</p>\n<p><em>Only nurses and other staff went on strike: what is your impression of the doctors? Do they support your demands and the strike?</em></p>\n<p>It always depends on the level of the hierarchy. The assistant doctors, i.e. the medical colleagues who work directly with us, see our daily misery and therefore support the strike. There is even a medical petition that many doctors have signed – including chief physicians or senior physicians, i.e. people in management. They also know that they cannot fully occupy their beds because there are not enough nursing staff. They don’t often say this so openly because they are also under financial pressure and sit in management positions. One question that always gets me is why we don’t all get together, from the nurses to the head physician – or even the management – and put our foot down and say: “This simply can’t go on any longer. Something is financially sick in Germany’s hospitals.” We still have to get that together.</p>\n<p><em>In Berlin, there is also a lot going on, also outside of the hospitals. The railway workers, who also work in the public sector, have gone on strike; at the delivery service Gorillas, there were so-called wildcat strikes recently; there are protests against the expansion of the autobahn – are there mutual references and solidarity between these struggles?</em></p>\n<p>Yes, there are solidarities. Just a short while ago, we were at the AWO (charity and big care employer) workers’ strike with our collective bargaining committee. Colleagues from the GDL (train drivers union) visited our strike. We are networked among ourselves and there is support everywhere. Sometimes it seems to me that a lot is happening here this summer. In Berlin, people are setting out to fight for a better city.</p>\n<p><em>During the first Corona wave, there was a lot of talk about care work and the poor working conditions. Do you feel that there is more solidarity and understanding for your demands from society than during labour struggles before the pandemic?</em></p>\n<p>In my perception, people have always had understanding. They just could never understand how you can go on strike in a hospital. Many were afraid that we would simply leave the patients behind. I think something has actually changed. For example, when I was standing in front of the hospital’s strike picket during the warning strike, an elderly couple came up to me and said, “It’s right that you’re on strike, that’s a good thing. They canceled my X-ray appointment, but that’s just the way it is.” I have the impression that the population knows that something has to change. People also understand that they have to actively fight for change and can’t always just start a petition. They understand that sometimes you might have to confront people head on in order to change something. Then a medical appointment might have to be postponed sometimes.</p>\n<p><em>Now you have carried out the warning strike. What do you think, will the hospital management come to the negotiating table? And will the workers vote for an indefinite strike in the ballot on Monday?</em></p>\n<p>In any case, you can see that our pressure has been successful and that something is moving. In a meeting with Vivantes management today, they used the word “negotiation” for the first time. That’s more than they did three weeks ago. It’s still not concrete, because the management hasn’t made any proposals yet, but at least they are now signalling their willingness to sit down at the table with us. But we need to keep up the pressure. We can’t let up now, we have to step it up a notch if we really want to achieve a positive result. I am very sure that the ballot will be positive and I assume that around 90 percent will vote in favour of a strike.</p>\n<p><em>The demands that were at stake during the ultimatum and the strike concern collective bargaining issues. However, there are a number of demands that go beyond this, for example in the ‘Health not Profits’ alliance, in which you are also involved – such as the abolition of the fee-per-case system and your demand for a solidarity-based healthcare system without profit logic. What could such a healthcare system look like and what would have to happen for it to actually be implemented in practice?</em></p>\n<p>There would have to be a different financing system. In the entire health sector, both in hospitals and in outpatient services, rehabilitation facilities, nursing homes, etc., the focus should not be on competition and profits, as is currently the case. No fire department, no school, no library has to make a profit, why then in the care of the sick? Something is ethically wrong. What is needed should be financed. If I’m sick, I need treatment, and that needs to be fully financed. The state must pay for this financing. We would not deny that it is also possible to work economically. But care must not be linked to whether an operation is particularly lucrative, and it should therefore not be prioritised over other cases. It cannot be the case that financial considerations determine how one is treated. We still have good medical care in Germany, but profit orientation absolutely must be abolished. Nor can taxpayers’ money and health insurance contributions be used to finance a system in which, in the end, some shareholders can pocket profits. That is crazy.</p>\n<p><em>Do you think that such a health care system is possible within a capitalist society? Many people say that housing should not be a commodity – and why should food be a commodity? But in fact, almost everything around us is a commodity. Do you think that a needs-based supply is possible within this logic and that the state will simply step into the breach?</em></p>\n<p>I’m quite sure of that, because that’s how it was in Germany until 2003. Until then, at least, the hospital financing system was not based on competition, but on need. Of course, there was a lot of corruption and abuse of power. But at least no hospital had to make a profit and be in the black. If the will is there, it is possible to turn this around again, perhaps not overnight, but as a trend. Even within the German Hospital Association (DKG), there are already such efforts. It is also clear to them that things can no longer go on as they are now.</p>\n<p><em>Another of the alliance’s demands is an equal distribution of care work between the sexes, whether private or professional, instead of cementing it as a task for women and families. Could you elaborate on what you mean by that exactly?</em></p>\n<p>In our society, it’s clear who provides care: 70 percent of the people who work in hospitals are women. In the private sector, in the domestic care sector, their share is even higher. It is a task for society as a whole to rethink this. This starts on a small scale, for example with parental leave. How many men take parental leave these days? There are still very few, even though more and more are doing so. There needs to be a change in thinking, and society needs to promote the idea that caregiving tasks are shared equally and that it is not the sole task of women to provide care. Men can do that just as well. If care work is always shifted onto women, this leads to women working part-time because they are still caring for relatives, for example. Then they automatically earn less than men – an endless spiral that we have to get out of.</p>\n<p><em>You are also fighting against the lack of autonomy at work and the hierarchical division of labor. What exactly does that mean and how would you like to organise work in care differently?</em></p>\n<p>I can report from my own experience at work. It’s often the case that it’s not us, but the doctors who decide what needs to be done. It often happens that the doctor intervenes in my profession more than is reasonable. That is a problem, because I have learned the nursing profession and I can and want to determine independently what is good for the patient from a nursing point of view. In German hospitals, however, it is not at all common, or only to a very limited extent, for nurses to have a say in treatments or in questions of care. Too often, the focus is primarily on medical issues that the doctor orders and the nurse is supposed to carry out. If we are to achieve a better appreciation of our profession, it must end with others telling me what to do. Of course we should work together with the doctors, and in many cases this works very well. But we don’t need these hierarchies.</p>\n<p>In many hospitals, there is still only a medical director and an administrative director. Where are the nursing staff? We are the largest professional group in the hospital. Many hospitals now also have a nursing directorate with equal rights, but not everywhere yet. That urgently needs to change. To do that, we as nurses have to become even more self-confident. We really have to stand up and fight for this; we have let this happen to us for far too long.</p>\n<p><em>Are such ‘marginal’ topics, which are very important for developing self-confidence in everyday life, topics that you also discuss in the current dispute?</em></p>\n<p>Yes, they are topics. That’s why this alliance exists. We started with the demand for more staff in the hospital, but in the meantime we have gone much, much further. This feminist perspective has become much broader and bigger, but so have many other issues. They’re not always all equally present, but we’re always trying to focus on new issues as well. For example, we have also started to network more closely with the climate movement, because there are many points of contact there as well.</p>\n<p><em>When you’re at a demonstration with 2,000 people, are there also sometimes nurses who carry a self-made sign that says, for example, “Abolition of the hierarchy” or something similar?</em></p>\n<p>Yes, there are. This is becoming increasingly important, especially among younger colleagues. At the moment, the main topic is the need for more staff, but precisely because it’s about better working conditions, other issues always play a role as well. For many colleagues, it is an important question how self-confident and independent they can be in their profession. If I work in a profession where I’m always controlled by others, then at some point I get fed up.</p>\n<p><em>From time to time, there are calls for hospitals to be taken back over by the local authorities, or the demand for ‘re-nationalisation’. Now we are dealing with public hospitals at Vivantes and Charité. Doesn’t the need to strike here, too, because working conditions are bad, make it clear that an even more radical change is needed – perhaps in the direction of a care revolution – in order to fight for a health care system based on solidarity?</em></p>\n<p>In municipal – public hospitals, one already earns better – in Berlin, you are only paid according to the better standards of the TVöD if you work at Vivantes and Charité. So although our working conditions are poor, they are still better than those of our colleagues in other hospitals. I think that remunicipalisation is the right way to go. At the very least, all clinics should be run by non-profit organisations. Private clinics should be abolished, as they are only interested in making a profit – especially the large hospital operators such as Asklepios and Helios. Of course, we can think about a revolution and whether we need a market economy at all. But for now, I’ll start on a small scale, with our struggles.</p>\n"}}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
