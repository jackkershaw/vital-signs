patients</h1></div></div></div></div><div class="max-w-2xl mx-auto"><div class="post-body_content__ye_eq"><p>Sometimes the hospital is overwhelming. It is like a massive waiting room of social crisis. Hundreds of people who are weak or dying, but have no families and friends. People who are homeless and have nowhere to go. Young mothers whose kids are in care. Prisoners who can hardly walk to the toilet, but are shackled to the bed with two gorillas sitting next to their bed. We can see the state that society is in, like a barometre or social sensor. Sometimes I enter the hospital, in particular before night-shifts, and it feels like a cathedral or a temple. There is no place in society, no church or other place of worship, where there is such a concentration of existential or vulnerable feelings. Hundreds upon hundreds of patients who feel the fear of their lives, who are scared of death and look upon their lives, who feel relief, who feel vulnerable and lonely. There is such a massive amount of existential energy and opening, but the hospital atmosphere reacts to this energy and opening with an industrious, professional formality. Of course, as HCAs we are friendly to the patients who we care for. But more often than not it is a superficial friendliness. Everyone is scared to intrude. No one has time to ask questions beyond “do you have children?”, “how are you feeling today, my dear?”. What would happen if we actually tried to talk about our lives and how we ended up where we are? As HCAs we have an enormous chance to relate to patients differently, because the patient is not in awe of our highly educated medical status, because we already have some sort of physical intimacy and because we have more time with the patients than our fellow nurses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This series will present reflections on the relationship between health workers and patients. We tend to see ourselves as different from the patients, and sure, they are in a different situation and position when they are in hospital. But unlike, perhaps, the middle-class life coach who would want to teach the COPD-ailing truck driver on the respiratory ward that he should have made different life-style choices, we, as workers, understand the condition of the patient. We, ourselves, lead lives of 12-hour shifts, which leave neither time nor resources for sophisticated life-styles. We want a reward at the end of the day, something sweet, or a nasty donner, or a gin tonic. After a week of being pushed around, of feeling trapped in a hamster-wheel, we want some release at the weekend, if you manage to have a weekend. Long hours and shift work is not good for friendships or marriages either. Many of us have arrived in the country recently. Feeling lonely and down and overwhelmed is not uncommon and has a toll on our own health. Long story short, we can understand most of our patients, because we understand what it means to lead a working class life. But this is hardly ever talked about. It’s all about eating healthy and mindfulness, which might make us feel even worse, because now being or becoming ill seems like our own fault.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Memories. “I work on a respiratory ward. One of my patients is a former ballet dancer, in her early 50s. She had a stroke or a tumour, half of her skull-bone is missing. She is bed bound and non-verbal, but she can clearly show what she wants and what she doesn’t want. She has aspiration issues, food gets into her lungs and causes infections. She has a single room. Her husband is with her most of the time. They kiss very passionately. I overhear a conversation between two nurses, who complain about the snogging. First I think that they worry about consent issues. But when one of them says “this is a hospital” I understand that they think that physical intimacy is not appropriate in a medical place.” [expand?]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the basis of being workers, whether in the position to care or in the condition of being sick, we can slowly start to support each other beyond the formal and sterile atmosphere of a hospital. The formal hospital atmosphere pushes most patients into two modes: either they become passive victims who hardly dare to question the ‘medical professionals’ and who feel like a nuisance and forced to be grateful for just about everything; or they feel that they are entitled to the best service, as taxpayers and people who might not have stayed in many hotels in their lives, and see us health workers first of all as second-rate waiters and chamber maids. It’s the structure that pushes people into these modes and neither mode allows us to develop a relationship of solidarity and equality between worker and patient. As workers we should help patients to ask questions, to make informed choices, to ask for resources, to open up and reflect on our lives together, to allow emotions beyond gratefulness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Memories. “I work on a ward that I call the purgatory. It is where they put the old and confused before they send them back to the care homes. You probably know which ward I mean. I am in a female bay. An older woman is in a state of constant anxiety, she shakes, breathing rate 26 plus. She repeats that she has to pack the two bags by Tuesday, when she will be discharged. It is Sunday. I tell her that she should not worry, that it is still early days, that we will help her. That makes no difference at all. My colleague tries the same, again and again. We are busy. We try to calm her down while bringing her neighbour to the toilet and brush the other one’s hair. The older woman is frustrated and she frustrates us. Then the hectic morning is over, I just want to sit down and look at my phone. After a while I go over to the woman, who is still distressed and still talks about packing bags. I tell myself: ‘be attentive’. I sit next to her and hold her shaking hands. She starts about the bags again. I ask her what is waiting for her at home and what she is afraid of. She tells me that she has only a nephew left and that she is worried that he won’t cope with sorting out her flat. She calms down for a minute, is more focused, but after a while she talks about the bags again. I ask her since when she feels so anxious. She stops and thinks. She tells me that it started with her breast cancer. I tell her that this is indeed very scary. I laugh a bit and tell her that it is probably less scary to worry about two bags than about being alone in a flat or cancer. That she chose her anxiety wisely. She laughs too.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is beautiful stuff out there on true compassion with and attention for patients. You don’t need a psychology degree. There is a geezer called Oliver Sacks, you can find a documentary about his life on the popular education channel YouTube. He talks a lot about ‘narrative medicine’, meaning, how important the entire biography of a patient is when it comes to their illness. There is stuff that Simone Weil wrote about ‘attention’ in the 1920s. She says that love is not primarily a cuddly, passionate or motherly feeling, but giving another human real attention. There is a pretty good book called ‘The Body Keeps The Score’, about how trauma is stored in the body and that, perhaps more than a shrink, we need creative, friendly, collective and physical experiences to unlock that trauma. This is a pretty random list, but it all helps to go to work and think that we can form true relationships, even if they last only a day or two.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the end good relationships don’t primarily need good will. They need time and resources, too. As HCAs we have to fight for better staffing levels, so that we actually have more time. And there are so many more things that could help patients make the best of their hospital stay. Some are with us for months and you can see how they decline intellectually, emotionally and spiritually. They can have a telly, if they are lucky and it works. We have this sterile picture of hospitals in our head that leave little to no space for utopian thought, where the time of recovery could be a more social, more creative and more reflective time. Tell us about your thoughts and experiences!</p>

It is like a massive waiting room of social crisis. Hundreds of people who are weak or dying, but have no families and friends. People who are homeless and have nowhere to go. Young mothers whose kids are in care. Prisoners who can hardly walk to the toilet, but are shackled to the bed with two gorillas sitting next to their bed. We can see the state that society is in, like a barometre or social sensor. Sometimes I enter the hospital, in particular before night-shifts, and it feels like a cathedral or a temple. There is no place in society, no church or other place of worship, where there is such a concentration of existential or vulnerable feelings. Hundreds upon hundreds of patients who feel the fear of their lives, who are scared of death and look upon their lives, who feel relief, who feel vulnerable and lonely. There is such a massive amount of existential energy and opening, but the hospital atmosphere reacts to this energy and opening with an industrious, professional formality. Of course, as HCAs we are friendly to the patients who we care for. But more often than not it is a superficial friendliness. Everyone is scared to intrude. No one has time to ask questions beyond “do you have children?”, “how are you feeling today, my dear?”. What would happen if we actually tried to talk about our lives and how we ended up where we are? As HCAs we have an enormous chance to relate to patients differently, because the patient is not in awe of our highly educated medical status, because we already have some sort of physical intimacy and because we have more time with the patients than our fellow nurses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis series will present reflections on the relationship between health workers and patients. We tend to see ourselves as different from the patients, and sure, they are in a different situation and position when they are in hospital. But unlike, perhaps, the middle-class life coach who would want to teach the COPD-ailing truck driver on the respiratory ward that he should have made different life-style choices, we, as workers, understand the condition of the patient. We, ourselves, lead lives of 12-hour shifts, which leave neither time nor resources for sophisticated life-styles. We want a reward at the end of the day, something sweet, or a nasty donner, or a gin tonic. After a week of being pushed around, of feeling trapped in a hamster-wheel, we want some release at the weekend, if you manage to have a weekend. Long hours and shift work is not good for friendships or marriages either. Many of us have arrived in the country recently. Feeling lonely and down and overwhelmed is not uncommon and has a toll on our own health. Long story short, we can understand most of our patients, because we understand what it means to lead a working class life. But this is hardly ever talked about. It’s all about eating healthy and mindfulness, which might make us feel even worse, because now being or becoming ill seems like our own fault.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMemories. “I work on a respiratory ward. One of my patients is a former ballet dancer, in her early 50s. She had a stroke or a tumour, half of her skull-bone is missing. She is bed bound and non-verbal, but she can clearly show what she wants and what she doesn’t want. She has aspiration issues, food gets into her lungs and causes infections. She has a single room. Her husband is with her most of the time. They kiss very passionately. I overhear a conversation between two nurses, who complain about the snogging. First I think that they worry about consent issues. But when one of them says “this is a hospital” I understand that they think that physical intimacy is not appropriate in a medical place.” [expand?]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the basis of being workers, whether in the position to care or in the condition of being sick, we can slowly start to support each other beyond the formal and sterile atmosphere of a hospital. The formal hospital atmosphere pushes most patients into two modes: either they become passive victims who hardly dare to question the ‘medical professionals’ and who feel like a nuisance and forced to be grateful for just about everything; or they feel that they are entitled to the best service, as taxpayers and people who might not have stayed in many hotels in their lives, and see us health workers first of all as second-rate waiters and chamber maids. It’s the structure that pushes people into these modes and neither mode allows us to develop a relationship of solidarity and equality between worker and patient. As workers we should help patients to ask questions, to make informed choices, to ask for resources, to open up and reflect on our lives together, to allow emotions beyond gratefulness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMemories. “I work on a ward that I call the purgatory. It is where they put the old and confused before they send them back to the care homes. You probably know which ward I mean. I am in a female bay. An older woman is in a state of constant anxiety, she shakes, breathing rate 26 plus. She repeats that she has to pack the two bags by Tuesday, when she will be discharged. It is Sunday. I tell her that she should not worry, that it is still early days, that we will help her. That makes no difference at all. My colleague tries the same, again and again. We are busy. We try to calm her down while bringing her neighbour to the toilet and brush the other one’s hair. The older woman is frustrated and she frustrates us. Then the hectic morning is over, I just want to sit down and look at my phone. After a while I go over to the woman, who is still distressed and still talks about packing bags. I tell myself: ‘be attentive’. I sit next to her and hold her shaking hands. She starts about the bags again. I ask her what is waiting for her at home and what she is afraid of. She tells me that she has only a nephew left and that she is worried that he won’t cope with sorting out her flat. She calms down for a minute, is more focused, but after a while she talks about the bags again. I ask her since when she feels so anxious. She stops and thinks. She tells me that it started with her breast cancer. I tell her that this is indeed very scary. I laugh a bit and tell her that it is probably less scary to worry about two bags than about being alone in a flat or cancer. That she chose her anxiety wisely. She laughs too.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is beautiful stuff out there on true compassion with and attention for patients. You don’t need a psychology degree. There is a geezer called Oliver Sacks, you can find a documentary about his life on the popular education channel YouTube. He talks a lot about ‘narrative medicine’, meaning, how important the entire biography of a patient is when it comes to their illness. There is stuff that Simone Weil wrote about ‘attention’ in the 1920s. She says that love is not primarily a cuddly, passionate or motherly feeling, but giving another human real attention. There is a pretty good book called ‘The Body Keeps The Score’, about how trauma is stored in the body and that, perhaps more than a shrink, we need creative, friendly, collective and physical experiences to unlock that trauma. This is a pretty random list, but it all helps to go to work and think that we can form true relationships, even if they last only a day or two.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the end good relationships don’t primarily need good will. They need time and resources, too. As HCAs we have to fight for better staffing levels, so that we actually have more time. And there are so many more things that could help patients make the best of their hospital stay. Some are with us for months and you can see how they decline intellectually, emotionally and spiritually. They can have a telly, if they are lucky and it works. We have this sterile picture of hospitals in our head that leave little to no space for utopian thought, where the time of recovery could be a more social, more creative and more reflective time.

Here at the University Hospital in Freiburg, our real-life experience hasn’t always fitted with this ‘reporting’. Where does this discrepancy come from? And why is there no ‘counter-narrative’ from our side? We came up with four possible reasons, which essentially revolve around the very different working conditions depending on where you work and the overall situation in the sector, which has not only been in upheaval since Corona. The following reports describe the situations in the Freiburg University Hospital and the Berlin Charité, at the time of Corona.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"wordads-ad-wrapper\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"atatags-26942-194877\" data-adtags-width=\"740\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eThere is a patchwork of wages – from pretty good to pretty bad!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn a national level the average wages for registered nurses with three years of training in 2016 were between 3100 and 3500 euros gross without supplements. In 2021, the TVÖD (collective agreement for health workers in the public sector) is between 3050 and 3750 euros (career entry / highest level) – without shift/weekend supplements and without the new, albeit staggered nursing allowance. Since 2020, the collective agreement of the university hospitals in Baden-Württemberg has been higher: between 3300 and 4200 euros gross, including the new care allowance of 200 euros from 2020. The private players in the hospital sector are also taking the TVÖD as a benchmark in their group collective agreements, which took some tough battles to achieve. A gross salary of 3,000 euros for an entry-level employee is now the norm in the hospital sector. Wages in eastern Germany are still lower! Nurses for the elderly are on an average of 300-500 euros below this – if their company is not bound by a collective agreement, it is even less! The TVÖD covers about half of the hospital sector, i.e. about 500,000 colleagues. A fraction of the other half earn above the TVÖD, with the majority earning between 10 and 20 percent less. While the total workforce in hospitals has remained relatively constant between 1991 and today, the workforce in outpatient care services and inpatient (elderly) care facilities has risen sharply since the mid-1990s (since the introduction of the long-term care insurance!). The increase was most notable in the private-sector (i.e. profit-oriented) facilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn nursing homes for the elderly and outpatient services, the TVÖD applies to less than ten percent of employees. The majority of approx. 800,000 colleagues have significantly lower wages. The wage differences are exacerbated by the fact that a lot of care work in nursing homes and outpatient services is done by unskilled or semi-skilled colleagues. The so-called ‘supplementary aids’ at Caritas and Diakonie do a lot of basic care in the outpatient services in addition to the house-keeping tasks, often at minimum wage. ‘Corona’ has led to people from the catering industry, for example, who have become unemployed, ending up in these jobs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is not easy to say what a universally binding collective agreement would really have done for people working in the elderly care sector. But the labour law commission of Caritas (a major charity organisation) was remarkably open in its reasons for rejection: “The collective agreement relating to care for the elderly interferes with the structures of our AVR [collective bargaining guidelines of the employers attached to churches], e.g., in the wage adjustment between East-West or our differentiation of pay between daily companions/care workers, etc., and unskilled assistants. This problem could not be resolved.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe workload is a patchwork – from okay to pretty crappy!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince 1991, the number of beds in hospitals has decreased by a quarter; in the same period, the length of stay has halved from 14 to about 7 days and the number of cases has increased by a quarter. Meanwhile, the number of full-time employees in hospitals has risen by 50,000, but this figure includes significantly more doctors – at the expense of nursing staff. [1]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are two ways of reading these figures: Personnel planners and health insurers emphasize the lower numbers of beds and decrease in utilization, which is why they say that there hasn’t been a significant increase in workload. They do not ignore the increased number of cases, but see the solution in a ’focused revision’ of staff cuts, a further reduction in the number of beds, the expansion of outpatient care, an ‘optimization’ of the work processes (digitization!) and, last but not least, in an ‘adjustment’ of the ‘mix of different levels of qualification’ on the wards (this means: the academization of nursing and a deepening of the division of labour). [2]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"wordads-ad-wrapper\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"atatags-26942-326046\" data-adtags-width=\"740\"\u003eThe counter calculation (e.g. by the union ver.di) sees clear evidence for a significant intensification of work in recent decades, based on the fact that overall numbers of cases have increased, the length of stay decreased and staff numbers have been cut under the ‘flat rate per case’ [Fallpauschale] system.\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn our job, it is not easy to measure workload and work intensity in numbers. Nevertheless, it is possible to identify a few common indicators that might differ slightly between hospitals depending on their size, trust owner or financial resources. In private hospital groups, saving on personnel costs is part of the business model anyway. And in elderly care facilities, the personnel situation is even worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e– After the movement around the ‘care emergency’ at the end of the 1980s, a process of individualization set in. Many took advantage of the wage increases to go part-time; others took further training and specialized courses; quite a few studied nursing sciences and the like. With the restructuring that has taken place since the mid-1990s, many colleagues left jobs in hospitals and went into the expanding outpatient care sector.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e– The planners turned the demand for ‘better care’ into an enormous deepening of the division of labour on the wards by means of sub-stratification: internal transport services ‘freed’ us from taking patients beyond the ward boundaries (and thus cut communication, which had been so important for organization during the movement); services for meals and other work, warehouse workers supply the wards with materials, MTAs (medical-technical assistant) prepare medication or take blood samples.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e– So-called ‘patient managers’ or the ‘nurse in charge of patient processing’ (a professional category) take over the administrative functions – and are absent from the actual care work. The remaining nurses are relieved of ‘non-professional activities’, but have more stress in ‘areas of high responsibility’. Due to the shorter length of stay, patients on the ward are hardly ever fully independently mobile and the high-intensity work involved in admission, treatment and discharge increases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe workload changes from day to day and depends on many things: a stressful shift can be okay if you get the work done well with your colleagues; conversely, a shift that is actually chill can be crappy because the cooperation is not good, the doctors are in a bad mood again, the ward manager is annoying, your duty roster wishes have not been fulfilled, a colleague became ill at short notice, or you don’t get along with one patient or another…. Actually, all of these things are also reasons why many people are still in the job: Variety!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut if you have no say in the process and the upper levels of the hierarchy can enforce everything, then it sucks. The disintegration of the ward teams through division and subdivision of labour have made it enormously difficult to resist together. Young colleagues are much more individualistic than they were 30 years ago. ‘Scandalization’ (portraying your general conditions as worse than they are, while accepting that management enforces smaller deteriorations), both toward colleagues and ‘to the outside world’, has become a necessary way to let off steam.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor a sustained period of time, the divisions in terms of wages and working conditions and the widespread individualization prevented broad resistance. This changed in 2015 with the mobilizations and strikes for more nursing staff – but so far only in a relatively small number of hospitals. Spahn’s Ministry of Health has responded with regulations around minimum staffing levels and the outsourcing of care costs from the general case-based flat rates (‘nursing budget’), which contain the total costs of medical treatment.

Market supporters want ‘community nurses’, registered doctors / GPs (increasingly combined in medical care centres) and large clinics. ‘Leftists’ want a state-planned and financed mix of community care, outpatient clinics and hospitals, in imitation of the socialist past.

With what ideas and ideals? Whose emergency is the ‘care emergency’: that of the patients or that of the nurses? Can these two perspectives be brought together? Does an ‘upgraded professional image’ also mean a better hospital? When we fight for more pay and better working conditions, are we also fighting against a society that makes people ill?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese questions and contradictions are entangled together in the minds of colleagues as well as in many struggles and activities, and must be held together in this contradictory way so that they can be solved practically! They are then separated by the planners – and in the collective agreement of the union: For some of the ‘problems’ (and the colleagues!) there are improvements and mostly complicated regulations – the ‘rest’ is postponed (or was not even an issue). The (struggle for the) collective agreement is then not a starting point for further struggles, but puts an end to a mobilization.

The employees in the health care sector are also caught between social care and the economy, between providing for others and earning money. Only if our critique of the ‘white factory’ goes beyond criticizing the ‘assembly line care’ can we get out of this deadlock. The ‘white factory’, too, is in its core based on our cooperation and can therefore also mean ‘cooperate in order to fight together’!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"wordads-ad-wrapper\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"atatags-26942-692050\" data-adtags-width=\"740\"\u003eThe so-called ‘relief collective bargaining agreements’ in about 15 larger hospitals were intended to reduce the burden on care staff. The first agreements were far too vague and quite complicated. They shifted the disputes to new institutions. Years ago, the colleagues in the Charité, a pioneering company, had emphasized: “The fight for implementation begins on the hospital ward.” But the jungle of rules and regulations has been stronger so far and killed off initiatives from below. The newer contracts (e.g. University Hospital Jena) are better. [5]\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe business model of recent years (essentially: “do more with less staff”) has hit the wall: it showed its weaknesses in both moral terms and managerial terms (quality deficiencies, lack of staff) and, of course, was also weakened by incipient struggles. A university hospital in Baden-Württemberg has the economic fire-power to react to discontent and change the business model – whereas in Düsseldorf the colleagues had to strike for weeks (with participation of many professional groups) in order to change things. In addition, management uses the ‘relief collective agreements’ to streamline the work process: they introduce new shift-models and so-called flexi services (similar to bank shifts); they cut informal breaks that were previously paid for on night duty; they enforce the expansion of ‘on call’ agency work and other forms of flexible working. [6]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ‘relief agreements’ to date are the result of the first broad mobilizations in over 20 years. The campaigns were designed for a labour force that had long been passive, individualized, and fragmented by the restructuring of the work process. The union was able to plan in a way that conserved resources – important in the face of declining membership and uncertainty about risk and expense. So far, this has had the high price that the collective agreements apply predominantly only to trained nurses, affect only a few hospitals and thus run the risk of confirming the mentioned tendencies of re-dividing the total workforce (implementation of flexible working and the introduction of a deeper divisions of labour). Therefore, it will be important for people to have the experience of taking part in broad strikes, ‘after Corona’. During a strike the daily cooperation becomes visible – because otherwise it cannot be blocked. For this, connections with other workers must be built, divisions must be addressed and overcome. Striking by means of adhering only to the “Emergency Service Agreement”, is only half the battle. That type of strike saves money for the unions and provides predictability for the employer – but on our side, it’s only ‘half a battle’ fought. [7]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is not irrelevant whether improvements are achieved by strike or ‘negotiated’! Only in a strike we can gain experiences that will have an impact on how we work day in, day out – the power-relations, the divisions. Nurses have an objective strike problem: our ‘work material’ is people. We can only tackle this problem if we treat the ‘white factory’ as a factory; if we learn to stop working together and to deal with the consequences ourselves. [8]\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe will only be able to achieve an improvement in wage and working conditions for all if strikes are extended to more occupational groups and to other hospitals. Otherwise, we will remain stuck in a modernization process of the ‘white factory’ with increasingly fragmented working conditions and varied wages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eAnd yes, Corona was and is a challenge. The pandemic is a cross-border experience, and our struggles should not fall behind that, we should learn from each other. In mid-March 2021, workers in the British NHS protested against a paltry one percent pay increase offer from the government…\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"wordads-ad-wrapper\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"atatags-26942-592787\" data-adtags-width=\"740\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFreiburg, University Hospital\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn spring 2020, management reduced the schedule for planned surgeries pretty late, but at the same time they mobilized lot of extra staff: part-time workers were asked to increase their hours, students, trainees and ex-colleagues were called in, ‘old’ ventilators were dug out from the basement…. Many were quite excited about the new challenge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, there were some familiar problems: a completely non-transparent hierarchy from top to bottom, incomprehensible decisions and procedures – especially with regard to hygiene and testing strategies. Disputes about hygiene regulations are not new, we have been confronted with viruses and hospital germs for a long time, but the fact that we were affected as a whole sector, not (just) as individuals, was a new experience. The fact that you were suddenly looking after colleagues who had fallen ill made it clear to us, more than all the figures and information about the virus, that something new, ‘something dangerous’ was on the way. In the ‘first wave’, younger colleagues also fell ill, and are still complaining about the now familiar after-effects: sense of smell, nerve problems, difficulties with circulation/breathing. Because hygiene became much more a question of personal safety than before, many colleagues were annoyed that you never knew whether the hygiene rules were made according to a lack of PPE (‘limited resource management’) or actually for safety. Most colleagues would have acknowledged that a balance has to be found between safety and ensuring care – e.g. by means of a transparent testing strategy. But what was sold as a ‘testing strategy’ seemed to us more like flying blind. Patients in the emergency room were tested, fine. Those who were called in for surgery were also tested on admission – but then went through the entire procedure from the ward to surgery and back again before the result was in!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the case of outbreaks on the wards, the colleagues always had to strongly insist that half-consistent testing was carried out… There are no hard numbers of infected colleagues; if they have been tested by their family doctor, they do not appear in the company statistics. The ver.di personnel council drafted an ambitious paper with demands regarding occupational health and safety, but only a few colleagues found it on the intranet; there were no steps to implement it. Overall, there was a great deal of dissatisfaction – not because of staffing levels, but because of the ‘handling of the virus’, but it remained on the level of individual whining that never turned into something collective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne main difference between first and second wave was ‘staffing management’. Essentially, they surfed the ‘second wave’ with the normal staffing levels, without providing extra help. Staffing on the Covid wards was/is still quite good, but ‘around’ these wards people were struggling as staff were shifted onto the Covid wards. One of the Covid wards became an ‘infection cluster’ (20 colleagues of different professional groups were infected), which of course again reduced the staffing level. The intensive care units also had only normal staffing levels during the ‘second wave’. This was very stressful for weeks, since the Covid patients required a lot of work for a long period of time – the usual ups and downs of work load were missing. The fact that it still worked somehow was due to an old, very experienced and well-rehearsed core here in Freiburg, who put the brakes on ‘the young ones’ when they got hectic: “One thing at a time, an intensive care unit doesn’t work any other way!” The 2:1 staffing ratio could be maintained, but it became stressful because of hygiene measures when a colleague had to look after a covid and a non-covid patient. The occupancy rates finally started to decrease from mid-January onwards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"wordads-ad-wrapper\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"atatags-26942-832229\" data-adtags-width=\"740\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCharité Berlin\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn spring there was some initial confusion as not enough PPE material was available; protective material and disinfectant disappeared from the freely accessible dispensers, as did soap, masks were missing on the ward, the FFPs were locked up and only issued with a signature. The Charité bosses talked of theft, and for a short time there were bag checks at the exits. Then, due to the scarcity, the instruction was issued to use an MNS-mask over the entire shift, including in break rooms. The hygiene officers added: FFPs were only necessary if an infected person coughed, or had to be intubated or suctioned. Fellow workers were all the more annoyed by the board’s assertion that colleagues were getting infected at home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the spring of 2020, there had been a lot of extra personnel, trainees, students and volunteers used, and at times there were rather too many hands…. In the second wave, the wards were asked to provide staff for Covid wards (usually voluntarily), the teams were then smaller and were partly filled up with staff from temporarily closed wards. FFP masks were now standard. The hospital, however, tried to compensate for the financial losses of the spring, and only shut down the scheduled surgery program at a very late stage. Additional intensive care units (ICUs) had to be opened, and experienced ICU personnel were transferred to the new ICU areas. Together with nurses from the normal wards, ‘pairs’ were formed, a so-called ‘skill-mix’, in order to be able to look after the additional intensive care beds. The ICU staff in particular felt that this created additional stress.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter shutting down/adjusting the surgery program, things quieted down on most of the other wards – but infections occurred again and again: Patients became symptomatic, or tested positive – along with one or two colleagues. There are no concrete figures, many have been tested by the family doctor and thus do not appear in the hospital statistics (which we also didn’t have access to). Currently, however, both the Covid infections reported in the Charité and the Covid infections reported via the health authorities are recorded (retrospectively) as occupational diseases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStarting in the autumn/winter of 2020, weekly swabs of patients became routine, with frequent positive results. During outbreaks, all the ward staff were also tested, which repeatedly led to wards being classified as ‘infection clusters’ and closed. At least one colleague was reported to have died without this becoming a broader issue in the clinic, as was the case with reports of deceased relatives following probable transmission of the virus from hospital to home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring spring 2020, there was definitely the sense that everyone was trying to get the situation under control. The cooperation between professional groups was more dynamic than usual. It was new for everyone, and you could learn something again. That’s all gone now. Political initiatives such as those of the Krankenhaus statt Fabrik (Hospital instead of Factory) initiative against ‘flat-rate payments per case’ or the current Zero Covid campaign haven’t really entered the wards. In 2016, we pushed through the first collective agreement that was supposed to bring more staff. There was a broad mobilization for this, but it ended up as a paper-pushing exercise about implementation of this or that regulation; the situation has improved in some wards, but not in others. The structures established at that time hardly exist anymore. Currently, ver.di is launching a new organizing effort with online general assemblies and campaigns geared to the upcoming elections in Berlin and at the federal level. It is not yet clear whether the Covid experience in the clinic will lead to new organizing attempts and struggles. The colleagues of the outsourced ‘service operations’ at CFM went on strike alone in 2020, ver.di ‘regretted’ after the arbitration in March 2021 that the outsourced workers were not going to be included in the Charité TVÖD (public sector collective agreement). Workers felt sold out…\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"wordads-ad-wrapper\"\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"atatags-26942-405137\" data-adtags-width=\"740\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOh yes, the Corona premium…….\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTowards the end of 2020, the debate around the Covid bonus also began in Freiburg. The federal state had increased the bonus to about 1.6 million, and with about 15,000 workers, there wouldn’t have been much left per person. In the end, 2,300 workers received between 350 and 1,500 euros. Very few would have minded if there had been no bonus at all. But many were annoyed by the confusing and unfair pay-out – “pay everyone an equal smaller sum, instead of such a chaos” – but again, there was no collective discussion about this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the Charité in Berlin, there was a Corona bonus of in total 450 euros, paid over three months during the spring of 2020, which I believe was financed by the state of Berlin. In addition, there was a staggered payment of 300 to 600 euros in autumn 2020 through the TVÖD collective bargaining round. However, the new agreement signed by ver.di stipulates that there won’t be any wage increases until April 2021! The contract expired in September 2020, so there will be no increase for seven months! Or at least only for care staff via the premium – which is paid for by the federal government!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the Charité hospital received money from the federal pot for the ‘first wave’; this was divided up according to an agreement with the sfaff council. Some people who didn’t receive any of this money went to the staff councils, but there wasn’t a collective debate around this either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e——\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFootnotes:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1 In 1991, there were a total of 875,816 ‘full-time positions’ of hospital workers (part-time positions were added up), 95,200 of whom were doctors, 780,600 general staff, about 45 percent of whom were nurses. In 2019, there will be a total of 928,000 ‘full- time equivalencies’, 168,000 doctors and 760,000 general staff. These shifts are in the logic of ‘per-case flat rates’: physicians bring in revenue, nurses cost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2 The nursing managers openly state that more staff on the wards, if it is not ‘targeted’, does not equal more quality and less workload. ‘Targeted’ then means new duty times and shift models in order to cover ‘workload peaks’.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3 These lower limits are only an absolute minimum. Regardless of concrete struggles and ‘countervailing power’ in the hospital, management still has the ‘power over the numbers’ in all these new calculation methods, i.e. the possibility to control the work intensity through the flexible deployment of workers / the control of ‘patient flows’. Moreover, in all these calculations, the work of one specific occupational group is separated and calculated as if their work was independent from the total work on the ward, which politically consolidates the divisions of the last decades. And the discussion about a better basis for calculation only distracts from the struggle for better working conditions for all!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e4 In addition, so-called “’maintenance payments’ are to be added to finance that the ‘flat rate per case’ does not cover – such as the masks now during Corona.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e5 In Jena, shift-related staffing levels were defined for each station. In a three-year transition period, the clinic must pay workers bonus payments or give them extra holidays in case of non-compliance (this also means a jungle of documentation, complaints, proof, calling commissions….).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e6 In Freiburg, for example, the overlapping (handover) times between early and late duty have been halved. The young colleagues complain that no meaningful handover is possible anymore – and are then given extra training by management. The fact that this takes up any breathing space in the working day and increases the workload is overlooked.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e7 “Striking patients away”: strikes by means of “emergency service agreements”, obligated the employer to ‘empty’ those parts of the hospital that announced their intention to go on strike within a certain period of time (no more admissions, reduction of surgeries, transfer of patients…). Charité management had also signed this “emergency service agreement” because they had not expected such broad participation in the movement, which is an indication of what is possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e8 In October 2020, there was a five-day strike in Californian hospitals. Because Corona regulations prevented union organizers from entering, the strike had to be self-organized. The colleagues quickly agreed that it would only work if all workers joined in. A separate “emergency service” was set up for the patient areas in order to maintain the necessary minimum care work. Unfortunately, no real improvements have been achieved to date. This could also have been due to the fact that the focus was not on achieving material improvements in wages and working conditions, but on improving financing for the hospital. On this front, the hospital management reacted with new structures (trade unionists on the supervisory boards) and vague promises to reorganize financing.\u003c/p\u003e\n"}},{"node":{"title":"‘Hospital and Emancipation’, By Nadja Rakowitz","excerpt":"\u003cp\u003eLeft politics, which claims to represent a democratic perspective that goes beyond capitalism, cannot be satisfied with the goal of merely redistributing the social wealth generated under capitalist conditions.\u003c/p\u003e\n","slug":"hospital-and-emancipation-by-nadja-rakowitz","date":"2024-05-09T10:07:56","featuredImage":{"node":{"sourceUrl":"https://vitalsignscontenteditor.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/03-krankenhaus.jpg","altText":""}},"author":{"node":{"name":"Angry Workers","firstName":"Angry","lastName":"Workers","avatar":{"url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a0f27e536deb935b37f956e7bad75489?s=96\u0026d=mm\u0026r=g"}}},"categories":{"edges":[{"node":{"name":"Debate"}}]},"tags":{"edges":[]},"content":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eWe translated this article from the German magazine ‘JungleWorld’ for the general debate…\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLeft politics, which claims to represent a democratic perspective that goes beyond capitalism, cannot be satisfied with the goal of merely redistributing the social wealth generated under capitalist conditions.It must at least strive to liberate labour from the form of wage labour and thus from its coercive character, to pose the question of property as one of capital relations, and to put an end to the violent dynamics of capitalist compulsion to accumulate. For the inequality that necessarily characterises capitalist class societies stands in principle contradiction to a conception of democracy as the form of a society of equals and free people, in which production must be self-determined, free of domination and thus must be democratically organized.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the example of health care, one quickly learns to bid farewell to simple notions of emancipation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is easy to formulate in such abstract terms. But what does that mean for the health care system? This can be discussed using the hospital sector as an example. Until the mid-1980s, hospitals in the German Bundesrepublik were not organized in an entirely capitalist way, due to a legal ban on profits and to the way they were financed. That has changed thoroughly since then. More recently, since the red-green federal government introduced the system of flat rates-per-case in 2004 and expanded market mechanisms, hospitals have been fully subjected to capitalist operation. This applies to both privatised hospitals and those that continue to be in public or not-for-profit ownership, for example, those run by church organizations. Just how dysfunctional it is to organise the hospital sector in this way, is evident to any contemporaries who are not completely narrow minded, in the Covid 19 pandemic.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe reform proposals for this sector can be used to illustrate what the difference is between a social-democratic and a left-wing but intra-capitalist policy, and to sketch out what a left-wing policy that points beyond capitalism and aims at a self-organization of society might look like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlmost all [German] parties except the Linkspartei [Left Party] hold essentially liberal economic positions on the hospital sector. Although they now want to improve the financing of hospitals’ maintenance costs, they want to centralise the sector and privatise it further. They hardly express any doubts about market mechanisms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe SPD at least claims to have recognised that the so-called economisation of the hospital sector is a problem. However, it does not mention that it was itself involved in the profit-oriented restructuring of this sector. Their concrete proposals consist of making small corrections, but not changing the fundamental mechanisms.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe SPD’s election program for the 2021 federal election states: “Profits generated from funds of the solidarity community must flow back into the health care system, at least for the majority.” The system of flat rates per case will be “put to the test, the flat rates will be revised and, where necessary, abolished”. Of course, “where necessary” does not mean Germany, but individual specialties, such as paediatrics or obstetrics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimilar positions can be found in the Green Party’s Bundestag election program: “The common good orientation in the healthcare system should be strengthened and the trend toward privatization reversed. The concentration on profitable services must come to an end. In the future, hospitals should therefore be financed not only according to case numbers, but also according to their social mission.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor employees and patients, this would be entirely desirable. In view of the interests of the healthcare companies operating in Germany, however, it is questionable whether the cautiously formulated will to somewhat contain the capitalist constitution of the healthcare system will be sufficient to achieve this. There seems to be no desire to take on the real opponent, the capital factions that want to invest and make profits in the healthcare system in this country. The coalition agreement between the SPD, the Greens and the FDP confirms this assumption.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Left Party takes a left-wing parliamentary position in its Bundestag election program: it is wrong that hospitals should be run on a profit-oriented basis. Private hospitals and nursing homes should be transferred to public ownership. They would have to be organized according to need and public welfare. We want to replace the system of flat rates per case with needs-based financing. “We want to replace two-tier medicine with a solidarity-based health insurance system into which everyone pays.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, this would not abolish capitalism, but at least capitalist mechanisms would be explicitly excluded from the hospital sector again and private ownership would be transferred back to common ownership – which could open up possibilities for further considerations. The fundamental distributional questions are posed in health insurance: A solidarity-based citizens’ insurance system should include all incomes and income types equally. All this would be possible and make sense. At least with regard to patent protection for Covid-19 vaccines, an internationalist perspective is also made clear in the program: “The pandemic in particular shows that pharmaceutical research is a public good. The licenses for the Corona vaccines must be released.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what would a left perspective on health care that points beyond capitalist conditions be? What demands would result from this with regard to ownership in the hospital sector? Should private hospitals, for example, be handed back to the municipalities, or should they be organized as cooperatives? How should medical needs be determined and who should plan to meet them? Should a central body be responsible for planning, or should it be democratised by involving employees, patients and local politicians? In which bodies could this be done? How should the mediation between these and a central planning body, which is unlikely to be dispensed with, take place? In short, how does one democratically determine the need for medical care?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe assumption that this need would simply result from the sum of individual needs and demands, and that everyone could therefore get what they need, ignores possible supply problems, because it is a matter of what is medically necessary. In the disputes and strikes in the hospitals, employees and political activists ask themselves such questions: Which services in the hospital merely serve profit, and which are medically justified? The former can be dispensed with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePractical experience gained during strikes in the hospital sector could also be linked to a transformational perspective: Strikers in hospitals now often no longer allow union representatives to conduct collective bargaining alone, but each ward or team delegates one person to participate in the negotiations. These units of action of self-organization have been experienced by many strikers as collective self-empowerment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the example of health care, one quickly learns to abandon simple notions of emancipation. A radical left perspective cannot assume that in a society that no longer produces in a capitalist mode, everyone can do what they want. Even under communism, people will have to work day and night in health care, and this highly complex work will have to be planned and organized. The question of which services are to be provided by society will also arise. Not everything that is technically possible will be socially useful. Here, too, it cannot be assumed that everyone will get everything they want. We can therefore look forward to conflict-ridden democratic disputes between equals and free people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarx describes this freedom as the “realm of necessity”. It can “only consist in the socialised man, the associated producers, who rationally regulate their metabolism with nature, bringing it under their communal control instead of being dominated by it as by a blind power; carrying it out with the least expenditure of force and under the conditions most worthy and adequate to their human nature.” This also applies to health care.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n"}}]}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/posts/[slug]","query":{"slug":"hca-philosophy-for-a-new-relation-with-patients-1"},"buildId":"ODvijbe-NHj4YQXbDi-cy","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
