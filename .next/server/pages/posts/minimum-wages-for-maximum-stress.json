These may not have gained as much attention as the big national strikes, but it is important to look at them to analyse what is at stake here and whether there is anything that we can learn from them. What is interesting about the strikes that have been happening in the last year or so is that they mostly involve workers in lower bands that were broadly left of the big national disputes.</p>\n<p>Now, Band 2 is a whole penny more than minimum wage per hour. You’ve got co-workers who have been working for the NHS for 30 years who are suddenly being paid the bare minimum that the NHS can get away with. We haven’t seen much in the way of a response yet, but when we do, we need to look at the struggles that have happened in the NHS recently, the strengths as well as the weaknesses to work out a strategy to win.</p>\n<p><strong>HCA re-banding</strong></p>\n<p>Most of the smaller strikes that we’ve seen recently involve HCAs pushing for re-banding to Band 3 with backpay to cover work that they were doing before these disputes. Mostly covered by Unison, these disputes have taken the tactic of short strikes and urging individual trusts to match what other trusts around the country have already done. In NBT for instance, HCAs were re-banded and awarded the lump sum backpay in January 2023 without having to go on strike, after a short campaign. Where trusts are holding out, we are seeing bitter disputes. In Wirrall, there has been the longest strike in NHS history, with Band 2 HCAs going on strike for 23 days at the beginning of the year, following 43 days in the second half of 2023. The Trust that manages the hospital have point blank refused to follow the trend of the rest of the NHS and NHS England have not stepped in to resolve the dispute. In fact the national body managing NHS employers has advised that keeping HCAs (or Clinical Support Workers, as they’re called up there) on Band 2 is in line with the Agenda for Change.</p>\n<p>It’s difficult to work out why Wirral are so reluctant to follow suit with the majority of Trusts, especially when the campaign that led to these strikes took place in 3 other trusts that have all settled with the union. What this does show us though is that despite the image of the NHS as a massive bureaucratic entity, where the government have the final say as seemed to be the message during the national pay strikes, that there is still an immediate class struggle at the level of individual trusts with local bosses. This creates opportunities for workers in one trust can set terms for the rest of the NHS. This looks like it’s what happened with UNISON’s campaign to re-band HCAs, where workers pushed both the Trust and the union to implement the change, and there was a chain reaction from there. Beyond the initial campaign though, the push has been entirely managed by Unison through official channels and it doesn’t look like there have been many links made between workers at different trusts.We need to develop these connections if we are going to win in future.</p>\n<p>The other thing that these strikes somehow bring out but haven’t directly discussed is how it seems to be a general tendency for workers in lower paid positions across the NHS are doing more work that used to be done by higher bands, not just HCAs, but across the whole range of hospital jobs from nurses to pharmacy technicians. As the NHS strains at the seams, instead of doing anything about the real issue such as understaffing and work intensification, NHS leaders are insisting that workers in various roles just work more, selling it as “career opportunities” without that ever translating to increased pay without a fight.</p>\n<p><strong>Pay enhancements and bonuses</strong></p>\n<p>The issue of pay enhancements being offered  unevenly is another issue that we have seen a number of local strikes over in the past year. The most interesting one was the Maternity Care Assistant strike at Southmead that also included receptionists and housekeepers. The Trust was offering massive pay enhancements to midwives but refusing to extend the same bonus offers to the lower paid workers, using the argument that they were not “first class staff” and could be easily replaced. The workers who went on strike made the argument that the work of the supposedly first class staff could not happen without the cooperation of the lower paid staff. Although the strike was well organised within the team, it doesn’t seem as though they were able to make much contact with other workers across the trust who were also not offered the pay enhancements, which could have bolstered the strike and opened up other opportunities for a stronger strike.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Selective awarding of bonuses has also caused other strikes across the NHS. Cleaners at a hospital in Dudley who were excluded from the covid related bonus pay because they were employed by Mitie instead of directly by the NHS. There was a similar strike in South London, where workers were on contracts with no sick pay and didn;t receive any of the Covid bonuses despite working like the rest of us through the pandemic.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In these cases, what’s clear is how divisions in the workforce are used to carve up our potential unity and our capacity to help each other in our struggles by managers, trust leaders etc. A lot of these strikes won small concessions, but imagine how much more powerful they could have been if they were coordinated with each other. The unions don’t seem to havehae much interest in doing this, they like to keep everything as separate as possible. It’s up to us to make the connections, create forums for discussions about strategy and tactics like where we hold picket lines and which other workers we need to talk to. The work we do doesn’t happen without theteh complex cooperation of workers with different skills and knowledge, our struggles need to reflect this and use it as our strength with nurses and doctors standing alongside cleaners and housekeepers and vice versa. Without this, they’ll keep beating us back one at a time.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Junior Doctors</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Junior Doctors’ dispute is the only national one still going on from the wave of pay campaigns a couple of years ago. Despite the more radical demand of pay restoration (35%) to 2010 levels, there hasn’t seemed to be much movement. The junior doctors were left isolated after various other groups of workers were sold sell-out deals. During the most recent strikes in February, the BMA union even told workers where they could and couldn’t have pickets meaning there wasn’t any physical presence of the strike in Bristol.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The junior doctor strike still has a direct impact on the work in the hospital. For example, on a strike day often only half of the theatres for elective orthpoaedic surgeries are in operation, because surgeons are sent to work on wards or in A&amp;E. But this impact alone does not create bonds between workers, in this case between scrub nurses, health care support workers in theatres and striking junior doctors. The striking workers are not visible to other workers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There have been issues with this strike from the start, with a lot of the messaging being focused around how junior doctor are worth so much more than other types of workers. This is a losing strategy, both for the particular dispute and for the working class more broadly. It’s our cooperation that gives us strength, and workers with more technical knowledge and positions such as junior doctors need to use their positions to bolster the struggles of other sections of the class, after all how could they do their jobs without an ary of support workers. The challenge will be for the junior doctors to open up discussions with other workers in hospitals, to work out where we can find common issues for struggle.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Understaffing</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Only one strike has happened directly in response to the issue of understaffing. Despite it being the massive elephant in the room in every dispute &#8211; in our day to day &#8211; only one strike in August 23 demanded a solution to the staffing crisis. Over 2,500 workers across 4 trusts in London went on strike, across various roles from nurses to pathologists to cleaners. Unfortunately this is an isolated case. Any conversation with co-workers gives the impression that understaffing is the main concern for most of us in the NHS, and it is an issue that creates a natural unity across all bands and job roles. If we are going to push for a health service that is fit for purpose, we need to be having discussions in every hospital with workers in different jobs, bands and unions to plan our struggles, and we need to learn from the limitations of the strikes over the past few years. Bosses have used the divisions that already exist to carve up our strikes and take away their bite. Unions have caved under pressure, offering sell-out deal after sell-out deal, and there hasn’t been an effective counter-balance which could hold everything together. Labour don’t look like they’ll be much better than the Tories when they’re in government. We need to use our position of strength as essential workers to put forward a plan for the NHS and enforce it through collective action, not just stick to individual moaning about how bad things are!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"},"posts":{"edges":[{"node":{"title":"Interview – NHS walk-in clinic worker","excerpt":"<p>Interview with a worker in an acute medicine walk-in clinic in a hospital in England about the situation during Covid.</p>\n","slug":"interview-nhs-walk-in-clinic-worker","date":"2024-05-07T13:52:53","featuredImage":{"node":{"sourceUrl":"https://vitalsignscontenteditor.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/35p5tajf25blhnfluhjz3rbuxu.jpg","altText":""}},"author":{"node":{"name":"Angry Workers","firstName":"Angry","lastName":"Workers","avatar":{"url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a0f27e536deb935b37f956e7bad75489?s=96&d=mm&r=g"}}},"categories":{"edges":[{"node":{"name":"Working Conditions"}}]},"tags":{"edges":[]},"content":"<p><em>Where do you work, and what does your work and workplace look like?</em></p>\n<p>I work in an acute medicine walk-in clinic in a hospital in England. The department I work in has about 25 staff in total, with about 7 to 10 on a shift at any one time, and the staffing is a mix of consultants (doctors), advanced practitioners, healthcare assistants, and ward clerks. We are open 8am to 8pm, and usually see about 20-50 patients a day, mostly referrals from GP surgeries and A&amp;E, and the aim is to diagnosis, treat, and then discharge patients home the same day.</p>\n<p><em>What happened when the pandemic started to become public knowledge?</em></p>\n<p>I was following it all unfolding in China, and then as it progressed across the world, so was probably more aware and worried about it than most of the people I worked with. From what the WHO were saying from the start it was looking serious and likely to hit the UK badly, and then when it was in Italy and the healthcare system there (especially in the north) was struggling I was increasingly worried about how our work (and I guess the wider NHS) might be able to cope, especially given there was no (or very little) discussion about it among the staff.</p>\n<p>As it started to become more common knowledge and understood among people here I had a conversation with a senior doctor at the hospital who also thought it was going to most likely be very bad in the UK. I’ve had various memorable moments throughout the pandemic and seeing this normally very calm and professional senior doctor look visibly scared about what was coming was one of them. As the pandemic progressed and the hospital started to change how it worked a sense of panic and anxiety became more commonplace, especially as it felt like that despite the warnings and time we had we left things a bit last minute. The hospital totally changed how it operated, moving departments about, discharging any patients they could, cancelling routine operations and appointments, changing work patterns, banning visitors, and making emergency preparations like turning one ward into a temporary morgue.</p>\n<p><em>How did your co-workers talk about it?</em></p>\n<p>Early on most people at work took quite a macho approach and felt that people (including me!) were over-reacting, and they dismissed it with ‘it’s just a cold’ or similar things, stuff that was common across society really. They laughed when concerns were expressed but then did start to worry about plans (especially holidays) getting cancelled. As the situation developed and they understood the seriousness of it people’s attitudes obviously changed.</p>\n<p>One of the things that became really clear to me talking to lots of other workers about the virus is where people get their information and news from, which is overwhelmingly online social media rather than the TV, radio, or newspapers, so of course there was loads of half-baked conspiracy theories and shit being talked about it. Some of it could be challenged and discussed or argued about, but it was surprising how much crap people took in and repeated.</p>\n<p><em>What did management do, health and safety or otherwise?</em></p>\n<p>Ha, very little initially. I was a bit shocked how slow things seemed to change, at least at first. It got better later on, in line (mostly) with all the official Public Health England (PHE) and NHS guidance. The Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) issue was the main area of conflict we (well, some of us) had with management, we can mention that later.</p>\n<p><em>Where people happy with that?</em></p>\n<p>Yeah, people weren’t bothered, at least at first anyway. Like I said there was a refusal to take it that seriously early on.</p>\n<p><em>What happened after the official lock-down that was enforced by the government?</em></p>\n<p>By that point the hospital had totally changed, and so had most of my co-worker’s attitudes. Visitors to the hospital were banned which made it much quieter, the usual flow of non-critical patients coming in had reduced, and loads of patients had been discharged home if at all possible.</p>\n<p>At that point in mid to late March there was a steady stream of Covid cases, but the peak was a few weeks off so it felt like we were waiting around for it to get really bad. There were all sorts of horror stories coming out of Italy, and various areas of the hospital were being measured up for how many beds they could take and whether an oxygen supply could be fitted in. The number of cases slowly increased but in our department we didn’t see them as they usually came in via A&amp;E and went to an ICU bed if really bad, or the Covid wing of an acute medical ward. As time went on the wards that had Covid patients on expanded and the hospital filled up with them in the space of a few weeks.</p>\n<p><em>What happened with the amount of work and the number of workers during the lock-down?</em></p>\n<p>It was a funny mix, our normal workload plummeted in numbers (people avoiding coming to hospital was one reason) but there was a huge amount of work moving department locations and getting used to new ways of working as protocols changed loads. We weren’t supposed to be dealing with Covid patients directly at first, just our normal acute medical workload of other problems, but that changed and some of us did get rotated through wards with Covid patients on, especially as the hospital filled up with them.</p>\n<p><em>Did you have more work and tasks to do?</em></p>\n<p>It went through different stages. At first early on it was pretty much the same, and then as the pandemic got more widespread our normal acute medical workload actually dropped right down as people were avoiding coming to hospital as they were scared. As that happened our department ended up a bit over staffed and quieter than normal. When that happened they started talking about re-deploying some on us to different departments. This happened after a few more weeks, and some of us ended up doing the jobs of junior doctors in acute medical wards as plenty of them were off sick at various points. We also ended up rotating through wards that had Covid patients on, although not the sickest. That was stressful and something people weren’t happy with at all at first, especially as it didn’t seem to be done in a fair way (sometimes managers would just send someone seemingly randomly from the shift) but it did settle down.</p>\n<p>Early on we were shown how to swab people to test them for the virus, but that very quickly stopped as things got worse our department stopped taking anyone that had anything that could be considered a symptom of the virus and they went to specific areas designed for it.</p>\n<p><em>Did management have a plan for this or did you have to improvise?</em></p>\n<p>A bit of both! One of the really difficult and stressful things was that management just seemed to be really slow at changing how things were working and communicating that to us at first. It felt like they were in some sort of collective denial about how bad it might be, and they couldn’t quite make the quick changes that were needed. I don’t know whether that was bureaucracy, or waiting for direction from the Government, or just maybe it was all happening at higher levels I couldn’t see. It did get better as time progressed, but at first the whole thing felt like a huge lumbering bureaucratic monster heading towards a cliff edge!</p>\n<p><em>What happened to the general conditions with things like wages, working times, shifts, etc.?</em></p>\n<p>Wages and shift times stayed the same throughout this period for me. Everyone in my immediate team are on permanent contracts with fixed hours and wages so that didn’t change for anyone. People were sometimes asked to do overtime on different wards and departments as other staff went off sick. Everyone had to work more flexibly due to working demands, and those with childcare even more so.</p>\n<p><em>Did relations between co-workers change during that time?</em></p>\n<p>Not in a way I can think of really, nothing more than sometimes there were what were probably stress related outbursts and minor arguments with each other. I guess sometimes there was a feeling among some staff we just have to get on with it rather than raising issues and problems. It is an issue in the NHS that there’s a real feeling of ‘public service’ sometimes, and this can be a break on any chance to do anything that might disrupt the normal standard of patient care. How to politically deal with that is a bigger area that’s worth discussing somehow!</p>\n<p><em>How about the relationship with management?</em></p>\n<p>It really varied between individual workers and what type of management you mean. Simply put there’s 3 levels of management that we have to deal with. The first is the immediate department heads, both clinical and non-clinical. They work alongside you (clinical with patients and non-clinical in a department office) and you see them every shift. Then there’s the management for the acute medicine area that includes A&amp;E, an acute medical ward, and our department. You don’t see them very much and they have offices in the hospital between the areas they manage. You might see them once a week, or if you’re in trouble or they come down for a meeting or something. Then there’s the hospital level management that you never see really, and they have offices in the Trust HQ in another building.</p>\n<p>Relationships with the first type are really commonly quite difficult in that they’re often friends to most of the other workers, and they act as a bit of a buffer between us and the higher level of management. If they’re good they will have your back more and stick up for you and the department when needed, but often they’re a bit caught between being workers and being management, and I know they found that hard occasionally, especially when they have to implement decisions taken by the higher levels of managers.</p>\n<p>With the second type a much clearer worker and manager type of relationship exists. They were the ones that we complained to about PPE for example, and they’re the ones that will tell us how things are with any changes and decisions, and if we get disciplined for example. They’re the ones that have a more direct impact on our day-to-day work mostly. They also find it easier to be harsh and less like workmates as they often arrive in that position from another department or even hospital, so they haven’t got that confused friend/manager/workmate thing the lower level have. In some ways they’re the ones that sort problems out as well though as they’re the ones that have the actual power to make changes on a department level much quicker than others. And this was especially the case in the pandemic when things were changing daily.</p>\n<p>The third type we never see as they swan about the HQ in suits. They might come round at Christmas wearing a hat, telling us how hard we work and giving out chocolates or something, but generally they don’t feature in any day-to-day dynamics that we directly experience. Although obviously the things they do impact on how the hospital works on the larger scale, although it’s a bit of a mystery to me what they spend their days actually doing that helps the hospital function!</p>\n<p><em>What about the relationship with patients and other members of the public?</em></p>\n<p>With patients that didn’t really change at all, or at least not really in any way that is important or that I can think of now. I guess outside work with the public saying you worked in the NHS gave you some kudos or something, at least it allowed you to jump queues in shops sometimes! Personally I hated the weird idolizing of NHS workers, made me feel a bit uncomfortable, especially some of those creepy nurses as angel images that were floating around.</p>\n<p><em>Did many people go off sick?</em></p>\n<p>Pretty steady numbers throughout the whole pandemic. We always had more than 1 person off out of about 25 staff, sometimes more. I don’t know what percentage were off over the whole time, maybe about 50% had some sick time off at some point, either for virus symptoms for them or someone in their household, or just with normal illness stuff. I think probably people were a bit freer to go off sick than normal as it didn’t go on your record, and people were a bit more stressed and likely to want an extra bit of time off, I know I did.</p>\n<p><em>If so, how did management react? How was work done with less staff?</em></p>\n<p>There wasn’t much they could do really. They didn’t put pressure on people to work if they had any symptoms though, and generally management were quite good with that aspect of it, although other staff grumbled when anyone was off as it meant a harder day for those that were working. We just worked short staffed sometimes, and mostly just got on with it, but like I said it some ways it was quieter where we were.</p>\n<p><em>What were the main conflicts during the lock-down? How were they solved or not?</em></p>\n<p>The usual minor day-to-day things as usual continued. Emotions were a bit high, especially at first, so there were some more overt arguments between staff on occasion. Someone tried to get taken off work due to health conditions, and other people in the department didn’t like that and thought they were being ridiculous. They’d got a letter from their GP saying they should be taken off frontline work, but management refused to accept that and said as they were a key worker they needed to stay. I told them to talk to their union, but in the end I think they just worked.</p>\n<p>The main conflict was over PPE. It’s a really complicated story, but briefly it really involves the NHS and PHE changing the guidance on what PPE needed to be worn for healthcare workers. They downgraded the level of it, and it seems to be that was partly due to writing the guidance on what was available as much as what was the safest.</p>\n<p>We worked in an area that wasn’t in theory ‘high risk’ like ICU, but we saw patients that did, or could have had, the virus and we were expected to wear a thin plastic apron, gloves, a surgical (non-filtering) mask, and eye protection. It didn’t feel at all safe, and we raised this with management numerous times and every time we were told that it followed the guidance and to refuse to work in it would result in a disciplinary. It didn’t really feel like we had anywhere to go with this, as it was true, they were following the PHE and NHS guidance. (I think some hospitals ignored that and made sure a higher level of equipment was available for their staff.)</p>\n<p>We once got delivery of a load of protective glasses (there was actually no shortage of PPE where we worked) that were a joke. Badly made and fitted they were one huge size, and fell off if you looked down or around quickly. We brought this up with management and it was ignored. Then a few weeks later someone at work sent me a screenshot from Channel 4 News with a picture of those glasses being investigated as inadequate PPE!</p>\n<p><em>Did the union play a role?</em></p>\n<p>No! I’m a member of the GMB, but there’s a mix of various union memberships where I work. I did chat to one other person who was also unhappy about the situation with PPE about getting in touch with the union, but the official PHE position on PPE made it really impossible to see how it would come to anything.</p>\n<p>Generally people I work with barely ever mention the union really, I don’t think they’d have any faith in it helping unless it was just for individual advice for a dispute hearing or something. It’s not helped that, like I said, in the NHS people are split between a few different unions anyway, so there’s less chance of any collective action happening. The unions feel really weak and distant to most people I work with I’d say.</p>\n<p><em>What was better and worse at work during the lock-down?</em></p>\n<p>Better was that there was a bit more of a feeling of ‘togetherness’ among the staff rather than the tension and moaning that can sometimes happen. It also felt like you could get away with being slacker with some things like your appearance and extra breaks, and also with speaking your mind. There was a bit more of a ‘fuck it’ feeling as we knew they really wouldn’t sack us or give us that much of a bollocking. For example we’d been told we couldn’t wear scrubs rather than our usual uniforms, as we wanted to as it felt safer not taking dirty stuff home, but some of us started wearing them anyway, and after an initial moan management gave up on it. It felt like some of management’s ability to threaten us had been taken away, or at least much reduced.<br />\nWorse was the chance of catching the virus and getting really sick and dying! And the stress created by having that as a possibility. Oh, and the PPE being inadequate to protect us, and then feeling like there wasn’t anything we could do about that.</p>\n<p><em>Has the source of income of your household changed?</em></p>\n<p>No, it stayed the same. Though we’re spending more on household stuff, partly as we’re at home more rather than eating out sometimes though, and partly as our foster kid eats more with us as well. I guess our bills are higher, and we did buy a couple of boxes of extra food bits like cans when lockdown started in case we got stuck in the house, and also one of us a bit got the fear society might be collapsing! When this didn’t happen we gave it away to a local food bank.</p>\n<p><em>Did you have any other ways to make money?</em></p>\n<p>No, we didn’t have or need any of that kind of thing as we were in an OK position compared to some.</p>\n<p><em>How did your household cope with childcare during school closure?</em></p>\n<p>Our foster kid turned 17 during lockdown, so we don’t need childcare as such, but she’s been home with us the whole time which has been nice, and I think going through this together has brought us closer really. At first early on in the pandemic she probably thought we were being a bit mad, but actually I think she ended up appreciating it, and realising we were looking after us all, and cared what happened to her and the family, which was maybe different to where she had been previously.</p>\n<p><em>Did family relations change?</em></p>\n<p>Yes, the other adult in the house who usually goes out to work 3 days a week started working from home, and the teenager was at home rather than at school from when they closed. There has been some nice things about that as we have had much more time together and felt more connected as a family, and we’ve kind of forgotten that social services are involved as they haven’t been in touch much at all. But also there have been some strains of home working in terms of stress and also needing the space to do it, which slightly impacted on how the house feels as that work and home separation hasn’t been there.</p>\n<p><em>Did you take part in, or use, mutual aid groups or other charities during lockdown?</em></p>\n<p>A few of us started a mutual aid group as many people did in areas where they lived. It felt like it had promise at the beginning, but we had some difficulties around what to do given we were so restricted under lockdown. We did start off having Zoom meetings among the 6 or so of us that started it, but they stopped after a few weeks. We did make some posters and went out and fly-posted a few around our area, but never got any calls and nothing happened after that in the group at all. I do think it had potential to build some local strength and solidarity, but one of the stumbling blocks to this happening was the activist thing of people just not having much commitment unless it’s exciting and easy, and of course the practical problems of organising under lockdown.</p>\n<p><em>What about your workmates?</em></p>\n<p>I don’t think any of them have been involved in mutual aid groups, and if they had it would have been from a charitable perspective unfortunately.</p>\n<p><em>At work have there been job cuts or have new people been hired?</em></p>\n<p>No, but recruitment has been delayed that should have happened, no idea when that will start again. In a related area it does feel like higher than usual numbers of people will leave the NHS in the future. Some people felt let down by management in terms of them being looked after, and of course by the government too.</p>\n<p><em>Has management announced that certain changes will stay in place? What are they, and how do workers think about this?</em></p>\n<p>Where I work nothing has anything been made explicit about any long-term changes, although there are rumours. In the wider healthcare working environment lots of stuff that was face-to-face has moved to remote working, mostly via the phone, especially for things like GP and out-of-hours clinic appointments. There’s a general feeling that much of this remote working will stay now, and I wonder long term if we’ll see the NHS get rid of some buildings and other things that they can release capital from if they’re not used.</p>\n<p>I think there does need to be some discussion about all these changes though and which ones we want and which ones we don’t, both among staff and the wider public, but obviously we don’t really have very good mechanisms for doing that. It feels that in healthcare as it does in other areas in society that the pandemic to some extent has just speeded up the changes that were coming anyway.</p>\n<p>There’s not been much discussion among workers I’ve been with about these changes really, apart from ones that directly impact them now like the remote working stuff. And opinions vary on that, partly by profession, and partly by personality I guess. Quite a lot of people say they like it though, both healthcare workers and patients, and I can see the advantages for some areas to work like that more.</p>\n<p><em>What do people discuss about the Covid-19 crisis? How do they see the government and the lock-down?</em></p>\n<p>People are increasingly critical of the government response. Everyone has been making Cummings jokes. They are sometimes a bit critical of others they see as being irresponsible for breaking the lockdown too. Everyone loved clap for carers, it gave people lots of pride about being NHS workers. I felt much more cynical about it, like fuck the clapping, I want proper PPE! Also it felt weird when we had neighbours having a party in lockdown while having a rainbow ‘Support the NHS’ poster in their window. People manage to have very simple and sometimes contradictory positions and understandings about the NHS and the workers in it. There was sometimes a real tendency to think of us as ‘heroes’ which is really grim, and also enables a perspective that almost excuses healthcare workers dying as that’s what heroes do right?</p>\n<p><em>Was there any discussion about what essential work is, and its position in society?</em></p>\n<p>No not that I saw or heard. There was a bit more of a collective feeling of solidarity between the various professions and roles in the hospital than there is usually though, as it sometimes is quite tribal between departments and different staff. There was also a bit more of a feeling of pride about working in the NHS and people really liked the feeling of being supported by the public over that. That and all the discounts on food they were getting!</p>\n<p><em>Do you think workers at your workplace come out of this stronger or weaker?</em></p>\n<p>It feels too soon to tell really at my workplace. I feel like healthcare workers generally will hopefully get stronger, partly as we’ve hopefully gained some collective confidence and public support to struggle in ways we haven’t for a long time. Although I think there’s specific problems and dynamics around political organising in healthcare in the UK that will make things very difficult though, the splitting of workers into sometimes quite tribal areas and specialities, and the ‘caring’ dynamic where political action might well impact on patient care short term for example.<br />\nThere are some new organisations and stuff has been happening recently that’s been partly provoked by the pandemic, there’s been a few healthcare related demos and a new campaigning organisation called Nurses United has started for example, but like I said, it’s too soon to know how these will go longer term.</p>\n<p><em>Have you heard about strikes in the UK or in other countries against the lack of health and safety or other crisis related reasons?</em></p>\n<p>Yeah, as ever I was a bit jealous of France and some of the healthcare workers there who rioted a bit! I was following other news from elsewhere too, but it felt very far away from where we were at my workplace and in the NHS generally with political struggles.</p>\n<p><em>Have you discussed the uprising in the US against police violence at work, and if so what do people think?</em></p>\n<p>Yeah, when it first happened a couple of people brought it up as a topic. The few people (all doctors) I heard talk expressed general support for it. I had a brief conversation about the situation in the US, and the support expressed (by Asian doctors) was from the liberal anti-racist position rather than anything more radical. People didn’t think going on the demos here in the UK was right though, they were critical of that as they were concerned about the virus spreading through crowds.</p>\n<p><em>Do you think the uprising has relevance for the situation in the UK? How about at your workplace?</em></p>\n<p>It’s been heartening to see any public political expressions of anger and uprisings at the moment really, although I’m cynical much will come of them in the long term. I think much of that area of struggle is very easily recuperated, and that it’s likely to take the path of least resistance in terms of demands and directions.</p>\n<p>Locally the mobilisations and ideas have been quite confused politically, with some more explicitly radical stuff mixed up with calls for diversity training and to support black owned businesses. It’s also has sadly been marred by personal issues between people involved in the various BLM (and related groups) call-outs. Some of it seems to be ‘community leaders’ struggling to be the authentic representative voice of a ‘community’, and some seems to be more overt political differences.</p>\n<p>I do think that there issues around racism in the NHS, on both the personal and structural levels, and of course this could be an area of political struggle, but I find it hard to imagine how this could be done really in the current situation, or at least without it just being about representation and equality within existing power structures.</p>\n<p><em>Any final thoughts?</em></p>\n<p>The NHS and staff are bracing themselves for the winter, here’s hoping it’s not as bad as it could be. Stay safe out there comrades!</p>\n<p>(Interview conducted in July 2020)</p>\n"}},{"node":{"title":"Interview with a community midwife","excerpt":"<p>This interview reveals, amongst other things, the amount of unpaid overtime worked in the NHS during Covid and the transformation of ‘professional online forums’ into channels to discuss working conditions during the lockdown.</p>\n","slug":"work-report-community-midwife","date":"2024-05-07T13:36:26","featuredImage":{"node":{"sourceUrl":"https://vitalsignscontenteditor.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/images-1.jpg","altText":""}},"author":{"node":{"name":"Angry Workers","firstName":"Angry","lastName":"Workers","avatar":{"url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a0f27e536deb935b37f956e7bad75489?s=96&d=mm&r=g"}}},"categories":{"edges":[{"node":{"name":"Working Conditions"}}]},"tags":{"edges":[]},"content":"<div class=\"&quot;HirTavAHiX&quot;\">\n<div class=\"&quot;LaKTzwPyhs&quot;\">\n<div class=\"&quot;lmDxYWizIQ&quot;\">\n<p>This interview reveals, amongst other things, the amount of unpaid overtime worked in the NHS during Covid, the transformation of ‘professional online forums’ into channels to discuss working conditions during the lockdown and, last but not least, the significance of informal care work for the wider capitalist work regime. I am a community midwife, working out of an office in a team of seven – four midwives and two maternity care assistants, plus our boss. our actual clinical work is done in a room at GP surgeries.</p>\n<p><em>How did Covid come up at work?</em></p>\n<p>It came in with quite a lot of fear for us, especially at the beginning. Everyone was self-isolating and we were still going to work – that was odd. Management didn’t really acknowledge the fear people had. It was incongruent: everyone staying at home and us going to work, seeing fifteen women a day, expected to go into women’s houses.</p>\n<p>I took my kids out of school one week before the offcial lockdown, because me and my friends thought the government was not doing what they were supposed to. There was already news from Italy and other countries. I think the public locked down before the government did. And our health trust didn’t do anything before the government did. There was even a bit of a time lag then. By the time the trust management did anything we had already been quite nervous for two, three weeks. There was no management advice before lockdown, no changes. I myself changed my work routine at the risk of getting in trouble. I am on various midwife Facebook groups and I knew that a lot of trusts were doing more than we were. And even our team was not doing as much about health and safety as other teams within our trust. The RCOG (Royal College of Obstetritians and Gygnocologists), who are the uber-advisors, suggested ways to safely see women less. They put a Covid strategy on their website, like, there were certain appointments you could do over the telephone, there were certan blood tests that you could combine. A reduced schedule that would not compromise women’s health too much. And our trust wasn’t doing that and neither was my team leader – but I was to a certain extent. If they ask me why I am doing certain things over the phone I will have to say that I was scared for my health. The RCOG guidelines could have been a national guideline, but the local trust said that there were not many local Covid19 cases, that’s why they didn’t advise to change the work routine. The measures taken varied extremely between trusts. I have colleagues in Hackney, in Cambridge and so on, and on the Facebook groups people were asking each other what each trust was doing, for example, are you doing telephone booking or 16-weeks phone appointments? The differences were stark, in particular compared to my team.</p>\n<p>In terms of the hierarchy there is the team leader, above that is the matron of community. She has about 50 to 70 people under her, about seven to ten teams. Above her there is the head of midwifery, who manages the different departments: community, delivery suite, anti-natal clinic, post-natal. We felt that our team leader was pretty bad. If you applied stricter health and safety measures you were made to feel like you were being lazy. Colleagues from other teams were saying: “How can she make you do home visits at the moment, that’s crazy.” That was the majority opinion amongst the community midwives. We cross over at the weekends, we work at different bases, there are few managers around, you tend to have lunch together and it is a bit more chatty – that’s when we talk about things. In an email our matron was also juxtaposing our health versus the women’s health, as if we would be jeopardising the women’s health. Of course, if a woman would say on the phone that she is worried for her or the baby’s health I would be there like a shot. But routine visits? So much we do is routine stuff, like screening the healthy population.</p>\n<p><em>Were there any efforts to coordinate certain changes to the work routine amongst midwives locally?</em></p>\n<p>Informally, yes. We agreed amongst ourselves to do certain things, like the telephone triages. Some also wrote to the matron to ask why we were not following the RCOG guidelines.</p>\n<p><em>And these national Facegroup groups are a bit more like the political wing of midwifery?</em></p>\n<p>Not all of them are that political, it’s also about midwifery student support, with practical questions. But they are independent.</p>\n<p><em>Did the character of these groups change?</em></p>\n<p>Yes, they can be a bit wishy-washy, but they became more focused. Lots of people discussing what to do and what not to do in terms of health and safety. That was really useful, because you can see where people in different locations are at. You could compare what is happening in different trusts, which embolded you. Peaople were asking on the forum: “How do you deal with 16-weeks appointments in your trust?” and 50 people would reply. That was useful.</p>\n<p><em>Was there a reaction to people changing their work routine?</em></p>\n<p>They were cautious, they knew what we were doing, but turned a blind eye. Which is messy. They neither said that everyone can do 16-week telephone appointments nor did they say that you mustn’t. We do it, but we feel unsure about it. In terms of PPE I thought we have the adequate stuff in the community department. It’s different from working on Covid wards or other risk departments in the hospital. For me the main issue around PPE was time, the time it takes to change and clean. This was my other dispute really. You have 20 minutes to see each woman in normal life, and that is still the case. But in these 20 minutes you now also have to walk down two flights of stairs, change your PPE, wipe all surfaces and so on and then go back and let the next woman in. Everything takes literally twice as long. They should have given us more time for that, they should have changed to 30 minutes appointments. I kept bringing that up, but then created my own solutions. I would book a double appointment for every fifth women. Administratively I can do that. Normally you would do that for women who need an interpretor or with mental health issues or complex medical issues. I think other people did that, but it was more of an individual decision. Again, you felt a bit naughty, it would have been better if you had the backing from management for that.</p>\n<p>There are bigger changes in the hospitals. Like partners cannot visit on post-natal wards. In the hospitals some people were shielding. There were some arguments about the question of who can and cannot shield. There are many older women in the job, but they are pretty dedicated and often rather go to work than take care of themselves. We had a couple of people dying, a porter died. There were not so many disputes between workers and management over health and safety. Work got a bit simplified in some ways. But then you also had stupid rules, like women in labour wearing masks. You are there with a sweating, puffing woman, touching her – I mean, if she has Covid you are going to get it.</p>\n<p><em>Apart from this mask rule, why do you think that management kept things in limbo or turned a blind eye?</em></p>\n<p>Management was not very pro-active. They had Covid meetings every day, face to face, but things were changing so fast, they did not keep up. Maybe they also had a different idea about risk, maybe they thought that things were actually not that dangerous. Perhaps because they are removed from the daily routine. A lot of meetings, but not much happening.</p>\n<p><em>Did the official lockdown change anything?</em></p>\n<p>It made it weirder for the women. Because it felt contradictory that they were still supposed to attend the midwifery appointments. Visiting us was the only thing they were doing and they knew that we ourselves would be visited by ten women a day. The baby might not have been seen by the baby’s own grandmother, but might have had visits from three different midwives, day after day.</p>\n<p><em>What happened with the numbers of workers and the amount of work during lockdown?</em></p>\n<p>We had more work, for example because of the cleaning. Then there were less workers. I normally finish at 4pm or 4:30pm. Now I would stay till 6pm to get the work done. Weekends we normally finish at about 2pm, I would finish at 4 or 5pm. If a colleague’s partner would have symptoms she would have to isolate herself for two weeks, also because there was no testing or track and trace. Loads more work because of people shielding or isolating. And more work, because even home visits took longer, with all the PPE and cleaning. During the peak of the lockdown I worked about a quarter again, unpaid. I felt that that was not acknowledged.</p>\n<p><em>Was there any discussion about working unpaid overtime?</em></p>\n<p>Naw, it’s his martyr NHS thing, a macho martyr thing.</p>\n<p><em>Did they bring extra staff in?</em></p>\n<p>No.</p>\n<p><em>Did the relation between you and your co-workers change during that time?</em></p>\n<p>Yes. Some of us became more intimate, also because of fear of death or getting seriously ill. We would get to know more about each others home life, too. We were the only people we were seeing during lockdown, we were keen to chat and make sense of things. It threw us into an intimacy. I also talked more to the GP nurses than before. And of course, we got all the freebies, everyone brought stuff for the NHS heroes.</p>\n<p><em>Did the relationship with the women change?</em></p>\n<p>Not much. I think it made us less tolerant with a certain type of woman who might be over-concerned with what seemed to us to be minor issues. We were working hard and became more irritable. But then there were women crying, because of increased anxiety and the fact that corona meant that they couldn’t get support from the grandparents. The cutting off of the women from their parents is a blow beyond belief. Grandparents are so important in the whole story. I had a lot of compassion for that. A lot of women gave birth alone, because the husband was alone with the older children. Awful things.</p>\n<p><em>That must be a severe situation, if we see, for example, that black working class women are both more likely to be harmed by or actually die of corona, but also in childbirth.</em></p>\n<p>The conditions during home visits were often tough. Overcrowded, no garden. Then the parents are too scared to let the kids out to play, so everyone is crammed in, kids off school. So many women with newborns at home, while the other kids are also locked in, in a two bedroom flat. Loads of places we go to are multiple families, one family a room. A lot of husbands are taxi drivers, they are at massive risk, sitting in a car with people.</p>\n<p><em>Did the union play any role?</em></p>\n<p>Naw, they are pretty wishy washy, to be honest. The Royal College of Midwives are half a union, half a professional association. They didn’t do anything. Nothing that I can remember anyway. They put out bulletins, but nothing that I could wave in front of management’s face and say: “Here you see, we can do 16-weeks appointments by telephone.” Or something like that. They played into the whole NHS heroes bullshit too much.</p>\n<p><em>Did the hierarchy with the healthcare assistants change?</em></p>\n<p>Only in the way that us midwives are better paid and our job is a bit more of a calling or a vocation. As much as I don’t like all the talk about ‘vocation’ from a political point of view, in communism I would still be a midwife. I like caring for women. In this way I am prepared to take that risk for other women. But to ask the assistants to risk their lives for shit pay, that is bad. They like the work, they like seeing the women better than the admin work. But I don’t think that they would come in if you said you can stay home paid. Forget the vocation thing, just look at their wages. Band 2 start on £18,000 a year, that increases to £19,300 after six years and Band 6, which is what midwives are on, start at £31,000.</p>\n<p><em>The government introduced a NHS fee for migrants, but then later on, during the corona crisis decided to exempt migrant NHS workers from that fee. Do you think that happened due to pressure from below?</em></p>\n<p>I didn’t see any local initiatives. The ‘Patients not Passports’ and ‘Docs not Cops’ initiatives did keep on going on that on a national level. It’s a campaign-y type of thing where we try to put pressure on trusts not to go along with the government thing in terms of migrant charging. The trust is who we are targetting, not primarily public opinion. That kept on going. But I think the whole thing was just embarasssing and awful and they had to take it back. First saying NHS heroes and then asking NHS workers to pay £200 or £600 to get healthcare. In a pandemic, to put financial or other barriers between possibly infected people and the health sector is nuts. You would try to remove all barriers.</p>\n<p><em>Did co-workers talk about how their families are coping financially? If people lost jobs, had to take on new jobs?</em></p>\n<p>The main thing was childcare, and the fact that all that is based on kids going to school. That was difficult for people. There is key workers’ school, but midwifery doesn’t go from 9 to 5. Key workers school increases the health risk to your family. So what do you do? Some people picked up lots more overtime, bank work at the weekends. But childcare was the main issue. People left older kids at home, but then felt guilty about it and worried. My two flat-mates lost their jobs in hospitality and found themselves without income overnight. I relied on them to do childcare. Other co-workers had their older children coming back from university and could rely on them. People had different strategies. But another reason why many of us stayed till six was because many of us were bloody bored by our children and partners at home. Home life became a topic and the question of social reproduction. People were supposed to work from home with their kids around and realised that that is damned difficult, if not impossible. Childcare is work. It revealed the role of the grandparents, and all the neighbourhood structures and stuff women have put in place, like play dates. All this is vital to go to work. This is normally invisible, the whole fucking house of cards is built on these informal relationships and if you take them away… everybody suddenly saw the unpaid work, because it was not done. It takes a village to raise a child, but the village was shut. You can’t put your kids in front of the telly for eight hours. There were these hilarious Twitter threads from home working mum’s about their child ‘co-workers’: “Today my co-worker smeared peanut butter all over themselves.” “I was surprised when I entered the canteen and found my co-worker had done a wee in their trousers”. And not just childcare, care in general is often organised informally, that all came to the fore. I think it’s interesting to see how society is built on these structures of social reproduction. And the crisis of the family form, like, being annoyed with your partners when you have to hang out at home.</p>\n<p><em>Did you take part in mutual aid groups?</em></p>\n<p>There are a few WhatsApp groups in the area. Mainly Muslim and Pakistani community, they were very organised and active. Some church groups. Our street had a mutual aid group. Wasn’t so mutual in the end, but good overall. In this area there were many posters, leaflets through doors and Facebook Groups. The local pub turned into a food bank. But it did not relate to the relationships at work, there was no workplace based mutual aid as such.</p>\n<p><em>Did the easing of the lockdown in early July impact you at work?</em></p>\n<p>No, PPE and rules stay the same.</p>\n<p><em>Are there any changes that management wants to make permanent, changes that impact on your work?</em></p>\n<p>This is very interesting and this is our worry about care really. We do slightly less care now to be honest, so the government or management could think that with less hands-on care, if there are no adverse outcome, the health of women and babies is not going down, that they might think that they can cut some services. The health visitors stopped working, they shut down their offices during lockdown. They only do phone calls, no visits at all. This has been a bit annoying, because we have been doing them. We would normally refer some babies or women to health visitors, but there were none. That’s another reason why we did more work. People say that the health visitors might have put themselves out of job by that.</p>\n<p><em>How did that happen?</em></p>\n<p>I don’t know, they are employed by the local authorities. I don’t know if that was across the country or just local. If the babies are not less well, that’s the health visitors job out of the window.</p>\n<p><em>Were the women not complaining that you were not visiting them, just phoning?</em></p>\n<p>Mostly not. Maybe a little bit. I think the results from the lockdown will be used to push through cuts.</p>\n<p><em>How was the whole Covid situation discussed, the way the government reacted?</em></p>\n<p>There was a lot of criticism of the government, of course. But then some co-workers also called the cops on people sitting in a park. ‘Can’t believe the government, can’t believe the public’ type of comments. Everybody thought that government should have locked down earlier. Some people liked the heroes thing, the clapping. All that sacrifice and war talk. But we all got a bit tired of it after a while.</p>\n<p><em>Was there a discussion about ‘essential work’ on a wider social level? Who is doing the work?</em></p>\n<p>Not really. The NHS is a bit myopic. We tend to think that the whole world is the NHS, because many friends and family also work in the NHS.</p>\n<p><em>Do you think you come out of it stronger as a group?</em></p>\n<p>I think stronger, because there was a sense of trust in each other. We have broken the rules together, and been through something together.</p>\n<p><em>Any discussions about the NHS bail out?</em></p>\n<p>No.</p>\n<p><em>Any discussions about strikes abroad?</em></p>\n<p>No.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Update</strong></p>\n<p>The past year and a half, since covid started, the workload has definitely increased and intensified. Mostly due to staff sickness, and staff leaving. Most face-to-face workers I know have some kind of exit strategy, or would like one. Either trying to get a specialist role that is less about constantly working at the ‘coal face’ or leaving to do something else all together, or early retirement. These are midwives with years of experience and knowledge. Although apparently something close to 30% of newly qualified midwives leave the profession within a few years.</p>\n<p>We work to strict and fairly inflexible work guidelines in terms of procedure, paperwork and admin, all the things that need to be double-signed, checked, followed up. And of course the care that needs to be given can’t be put off for another day. If a newborn baby and mum need a home visit the first day back from hospital, it does have to be done that day. I am supposed to work an 8 hour day, but if I am the only one from my team in, and I have to get through the work of the day in terms of the women and babies who need to be seen, plus all the various procedures, it does not fit into 8 hours. So I often leave work an hour or even two hours late. I can put this on my time sheet as extra hours, but still. I am a single mum and my childcare arrangements often have to be stretched and bent and I ask people for favours all the time due to being late home. You can’t really run the service we are expected to run, and keep to all the guidelines, and have the number of staff we do. It just doesn’t fit. There is a constant looming fear that you will miss something and it will be your fault. That you will either get in trouble with management, or of course worst of all, a baby or mother will get sick because you missed something. They try to keep the quality of work up by threats of ‘loosing your PIN’, but its not a great motivation to be honest. When I worked on postnatal ward and we were so busy that you sometimes didn’t see women for hours I had a dread of someone dying or getting seriously ill on my shift and it would be my fault. In another trust I worked in we used to put in ‘datex’ for low staffing so that if something happened it would be clear that we had seen it was an unsafe situation and had tried to escalate it. But management told us not to do that. We were trying to legally cover our backs, and raise the issue as a problem.</p>\n<p>There has been a big national re-organisation of midwifery in the past year. Yes, in the middle of a pandemic they have totally restructured the work organisation. It is called Continuity teams and comes from a report called Better Births. The aims are laudable and were intended to be more woman centred, but does not really work in a regimented hierarchical NHS system based on shift work and structured work hours. In practice it means most midwives doing some community work, and then either some 12 hour hospital shifts or 12 hour on-calls. This is leading to exhaustion and burn out. The idea is that the birthing woman knows her midwife, but it is organised in teams of 8, so it can feel a bit like a tick box exercise. Independent (non NHS) midwife teams worked with continuity, i.e. the midwife you see in the pregnancy also attends the delivery, but they had a much greater level of trust and autonomy for the midwives. The midwives could organise their own timetables to ensure the work got done. Expecting the level of continuity and night and weekend work, without the respect of being able to organise your own workload feels like a strain that might not pay off in the long run. As it is a government led initiative, all trusts have to implement it.</p>\n<p>At work we don’t really talk about the pay issue so much in specifics. Of course we moan about the pay. The band 3 maternity care assistant work as hard as the midwives, doing many of the same duties, but get much less. Mostly it is seen as a given that it is relatively low paid work and people try to manage by doing weekends and nights, or thinking of a way to leave midwifery. The ‘heroes and angels’ narrative was really annoying on this level. The idea that we are selfless workhorses who do it because it is a calling is irritating when you are late home from work, hungry, the kids haven’t had dinner and the pay is low.</p>\n<p><strong>Spring 2022</strong></p>\n"}},{"node":{"title":"The struggle for better staffing levels in hospitals – UK nurse interview and a response from Germany","excerpt":"<p>The struggle for better staffing levels is a struggle against stress, burnout, bitching and bad vibes amongst colleagues and against the neglect of patients.</p>\n","slug":"the-struggle-for-better-staffing-levels-in-hospitals-uk-nurse-interview-and-a-response-from-germany","date":"2024-05-07T13:27:03","featuredImage":{"node":{"sourceUrl":"https://vitalsignscontenteditor.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/290666799_112523524834443_9031904856356781193_n.jpg","altText":""}},"author":{"node":{"name":"Angry Workers","firstName":"Angry","lastName":"Workers","avatar":{"url":"https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a0f27e536deb935b37f956e7bad75489?s=96&d=mm&r=g"}}},"categories":{"edges":[{"node":{"name":"Working Conditions"}}]},"tags":{"edges":[]},"content":"<p><em>The struggle for better staffing levels is a struggle against stress, burnout, bitching and bad vibes amongst colleagues and against the neglect of patients. If we are overworked, everyone loses out. During recent and current strikes in Germany, we could see that the struggle for better staffing levels is possible.</em></p>\n<p><em>In Germany, workers managed to put the ball in management’s court: the new collective contract says that for each understaffed shift that you work, management has to either give you time off or compensate you financially. This should be an incentive for them to finally do something about the issue (- it still has to be seen if that really changes things on the ward floor).</em></p>\n<p><em>The struggle for better staffing levels is a joined-up struggle. If nurses are overworked, they cannot help healthcare assistants (HCAs) with washing patients or making beds. If, as a result of that, HCAs are overworked, then they can’t give a hand to housekeepers during tea rounds or meal-times. The whole situation is a chain reaction of bad vibes and stress. The question is: how we can turn the fact that we work together and are dependent on each other’s work into a collective strength?</em></p>\n<p><em>Below you can find some material for discussion. We start with a report from a housekeeper in a hospital in the South-West of England who organised a petition against low staffing levels on her ward. We then have a detailed interview with a nurse about how work is organised and divided on her ward and how staffing levels impact her work. We finally have a response from a nurse in Germany who compares conditions in the UK with his local hospital.</em></p>\n<p><em>If you work in the health sector, why don’t you send us some notes on your own experiences and thoughts on the matter!</em></p>\n<p><em>Angry Health Workers, Spring 2022</em></p>\n<p><strong>*** Petition against bad staffing levels</strong></p>\n<p>I’ve been working on a covid ward in Bristol for the last year, and like most of the other hospital wards, it has been chronically understaffed. Bank workers (who are like internal agency workers) are being sent text messages offering 50% more to come in for extra shifts. Expecting any permanent staff to come in for extra shifts after they’ve already worked three 12.5 hour long shifts when tax claws back most of the extra money anyway, is unlikely, and it’s only a short-term fix. We’re used to chronic understaffing on our ward, but with all of the staff catching covid at one time or another and being off sick, things were even worse.</p>\n<p>After being covid-free for a couple of months, we’re now in the middle of another outbreak. Many of the patients need 1:1 care, which we can’t give them. More patients are at higher risk of falls. Many just want a chat because they’re going stir-crazy, and we don’t have time to just sit down with them. Around 6 nurses have left my ward in the last few months, another three are planned to leave over the summer. This is unprecedented. But inevitable when nurses and healthcare assistants are running around trying to keep things from going into absolute meltdown.</p>\n<p>A few months ago, a wandering, confused, and aggressive patient, who should have been under 1:1 supervision, punched a worker in the ribs, fracturing one. A patient almost died of a suicide attempt because they weren’t able to be watched continuously. The NHS can do the bare minimum to patch people up, but without a long-term staffing plan – which includes higher wages, shorter shifts, and better terms and conditions – and workers’ fighting back – it will carry on being run into the ground.</p>\n<p>On my ward, we decided to write a collective letter to the Chief Exec of the Trust to voice our anger. 40 staff signed it: from cleaners to staff nurses. At the very least we should be letting the people know we are not happy. This was a small first step, intended to galvanise some people into action. I prepared people for the fact that the letter per se wouldn’t do much, but tried to get them to think of ways we could use the letter to widen the action. Predictably, the Chief Exec gave us a standard reply, but the fact that a few of us went to hand the letter in personally, and the fact that we then put the news of it into the union newsletter and distributed this around the hospital made management sit up a bit.</p>\n<p>But people on my ward didn’t want to do much after the letter. I suggested we go to other wards, or say we wanted a face to face meeting, but everyone retreated, people got scared and nervous. Many choose to leave the job instead. So, what next? Some of us will do a bigger petition across the hospital calling for solutions to understaffing and stress. In the hospital strikes in Berlin, they demanded extra pay or time off in lieu every time their ward was understaffed. Maybe this is something that most staff can get behind at my hospital. We know we need more action across different groups of workers, different departments, different unions. We just need to try different things at different times to see if anything sparks a more engaged and sustained response from workers. That this coincides with the upcoming pay offer will be important. Let’s see if people are up for it…</p>\n<p><strong>*** Interview on staffing levels with a nurse, April 2022</strong></p>\n<p>Question: In order to compare staffing levels, it’s obviously important to know what nurses have to do, which differs from place to place, especially of course on an international level. On our ward the usual staffing level is 1:8 for patients in single rooms and up to 1:10 in bays. That means that one nurse and ideally one health care assistant look after eight to ten patients. What does this mean in terms of daily work tasks?</p>\n<p>The first thing we do is handover, which can take up to 20-30 minutes. Then the drug round, which often means you have to find the drugs that you need. It’s all still done on paper, the drug charts. The drugs are often out of stock. If you’re lucky they are in the drug trolley that each nurse gets, which contains common medication, such as pain relief or antibiotics. Some drugs might be in the patient’s room if they have their own medication. The next place where you can search is the general cupboard on your ward, but sometimes you have to go to other wards or order from the pharmacy. The drug round can take 1-1.5 hours. In some Trusts you are more protected, you wear a red apron saying, ‘I am doing my drug round, please don’t disturb’, so people can concentrate better and make less errors. General medication is only checked by one nurse, but injections and IVs are checked by two nurses. You often find prescription errors in the drug charts, mistakes that doctors made, for example forgetting to sign a prescription.</p>\n<p>If you have the time you then support your health care assistant, like washing patients who need help, getting them dressed or making beds. You then do clinical observations, basically a round of checking blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and so on. If they had the last check at 6 o’clock in the morning they are due again at around 10 o’clock, unless they are poorly and need checking more frequently. That takes you to around 11 to 11:30am. You start your 12 o’clock drug round, which might have IVs in it. Each time you see a patient on the round there might be something they need, like getting to the toilet. Then you have tasks that the doctors requested on their morning round, that should usually be done by then. You might have bloods to take or families to call or people might have to go for scans. Then there is lunch-time, people might need assistance with eating. You then do an afternoon set of clinical observations at around 2 o’clock. There might be patient discharges, then you have to get the notes ready, inform pharmacy, contact district nurses and get them ready for going home. You then have an evening drug round at about six o’clock. There can be a lot of IVs in that. Then you start thinking about writing notes, so eight sets of notes. In general, you have to finish all the paperwork by then. You prepare the handover for the next nurse. The three daily drug rounds definitely take up most of the time, then the observations, in particular when patients deteriorate and you have to do them hourly, then all the documentation.</p>\n<p><em>Question: So what creates the actual stress? Is it that there are too many tasks for the day or is it the way things are organised, for example, because hierarchies and responsibilities are not clear?</em></p>\n<p>Stress can develop because you think you are not doing a good enough job for your patients. I remember having patients who had been given bad news and not being able to spend enough time with them exploring that bad news, because there are a hundred other things to do. If you have an end-of-life patient, you are supposed to check them hourly. You often feel that you’ve failed them, that you had no time to give them mouth care, personal care, some time to talk. The stress can also come from a fear of mistakes. I often found drug rounds stressful, because things were often not clear and you had to chase things up, because otherwise it would fall back on you. Often you have trouble getting hold of doctors or pharmacy to verify information. Sometimes it takes half an hour to sort out one drug for one of your patients. A lack of teamwork can also make people feel stressed. You are visibly stressed while someone sits down and has a cup of tea.</p>\n<p><em>Question: Do you often have to stay longer to finish your work?</em></p>\n<p>When I joined the ward as a newly qualified nurse, the ward manager said: “You’re newly qualified, you won’t go home on time”. For the first four to six months I stayed on late every single shift, at least fifteen minutes, up to an hour. Finishing paperwork, checking things, going back over my drug charts. Then I started to get into more of a routine. Perhaps I became less conscientious about my notes. If patients were well, perhaps I didn’t write each detail down like I was at the beginning. They tell you as a nurse that if you do good documentation and it can be proven, that that speaks in your favour if you ever get taken in front of the NMC [Nursing and Midwifery Council). That’s in the back of your mind. I think when they stopped allowing visitors during the first phase of Covid, we got some of our time back. We wouldn’t be stopped that often and asked questions. We were able to leave on time then. I moved to the high-dependency unit, where you only have four patients. Although people are sicker, you manage to go home on time.</p>\n<p><em>Question: If you had a health care assistant with you, does a staffing ratio of 1:8 feel understaffed?</em></p>\n<p>That can also depend on the skill of the health care assistant. You have some HCAs who won’t do blood sugars or observations or the documentation, because they say they don’t know how. Then you have HCAs who are so trained up, they do your bloods for you. It is such a wide range. The skill mix. And they are not very good at putting a very experienced HCA with a new nurse. Often it is the other way around, experienced HCAs want to work with their friends, the more experienced nurses.</p>\n<p><em>Question: You mentioned that bad teamwork is a stress factor. What is a hindrance to more conscious working together?</em></p>\n<p>I think it’s a culture thing. About feeling you shouldn’t ask people to help you. Some wards are bad at not organising breaks. It’s all done individually, if you find a ten minute slot, you just go on your break. On other wards it’s better organised, there is a clearer structure and you know that you are covered when you are on break – someone knows what has to be done while you are on break. You have a quick conversation with someone, before you go, and they cover you. And you would do it for them, so they don’t have to worry during their break. On some wards that’s not the case. No one would take a message, for example from doctors, while you are away. Everyone just tries to keep their head above water and their section in order.</p>\n<p><em>Question: What would it take to introduce such a bit more conscious cooperation on a ward? The NHS is so formalised and hierarchical that people might often feel that they cannot change anything themselves?</em></p>\n<p>I think unless the nurse in charge doesn’t go to people and tell them that this is your time to go on break, it would be difficult. But then people have also been burnt, when those people who took over during break have made mistakes with ‘their patients’. People stopped trusting each other. Because it will come back on you. They think: “I’d rather do it myself”. In the community you have just one pair of eyes checking that the medication is right.</p>\n<p><em>Question: Who decides whether to take on new patients, even in a situation of low staffing? Do normal nurses have a say?</em></p>\n<p>I think they could, I’ve seen it happen. I’ve been on the receiving end of it. For example, when one of my patients died, the head nurse told me that they won’t immediately report it to the department that retrieves deceased patients from the ward, just to give me a little breathing space and not immediately fill that room again. But I think that when there are planned discharges, that goes above the level of the person that is in charge of the ward. The head nurse reports what potential discharges there are, then the top people will keep on phoning asking how you get on with the discharges. Ultimately is the decision of the people above the ward level.</p>\n<p><em>Question: In Australia in some organised hospitals the union just closes beds if staffing levels are too low.</em></p>\n<p>The problem is that their solution is to bring in agency staff and agency staff can often cause more work for the regular staff, as they might not know the protocol of how to do things. The head nurse or ward manager don’t trust the agency staff, so they give them the easiest patients, the least amount of work to do. The agency staff have no desire, I mean, they don’t have any ties to the ward, they don’t feel the need to help the other staff. That’s of course not always true. Bank staff often return to the same ward, agency staff rarely. There is often an atmosphere towards agency staff: “She earns three times as much as we do for this shift, let her do it”. If you have intensive care skills you earn £40 to £50 an hour. That’s a problematic solution for staffing issues. In the local community hospital they run teams with one permanent staff and three agency staff at the moment. Agency staff come from places like Leeds or Liverpool, they get food and accommodation paid for the four, five shifts that they are here. The feeling of the permanent staff is: why is management not paying for training, why don’t we get unskilled, why are we paying for accommodation?!</p>\n<p><em>Question: In Germany the union demanded that for each understaffed shift that you work you get extra holiday or a compensation payment. What do you think about this, are there other things that could reduce stress?</em></p>\n<p>The skill level is important. If you have more skilled healthcare assistants, that makes your life so much easier. They used to get all kinds of training, but they stopped that. For me. That created also a bit more of a partnership with the HCA. At the beginning of each shift, if I didn’t know the HCA, I would ask them: what can you do, can you do blood sugars, clinical observations, bloods? Sometimes they say they can, but they are not prepared to do it, as they are on a Band 2 shift. At the other local hospital every HCA is trained on the same level; that creates a different situation, when everyone knows what people can do. With staffing we were kind of lucky, because we always had a nurse in charge who didn’t have patients themselves. So they can be an extra person to help out. Another thing that would decrease the workload would be to stop duplicating documentation. Why do I have to write down the same thing in three different charts? IT can make a difference here, it often means that you have all information accessible, rather than having to spend ages looking around for it. My worry when it comes to the German demand is that if I get extra time off after an understaffed shift the ward will be understaffed on a different day. Who stops them from riding me, asking me to come in on my day off? It’s not really addressing the issue of general lack of staff. You give people more time off, the nurses that I know would use it to pick up an extra agency shift.</p>\n<p><em>Question: I guess it’s a double edged sword, as it also makes everything even more transparent by recording each work step electronically and management can squeeze out any spare time. The same with the skill mix, if nursing associates now do a lot of nurses’ jobs, just for much less pay.</em></p>\n<p>True. I just try to get some teamwork going. I tend to inform the HCAs in my section, for example, about what the doctor told me regarding the development of a patient. Some HCAs respond: “Why are you telling me this? This is not my information.” In general many HCAs are not kept in the loop, though they should be. There is a problem of trust, as well. Many nurses think that ultimately it is their head that is on the line, they pay for mistakes that HCAs make. There is no protection in that sense.</p>\n<p><em>Question: All this really hampers communication and cooperation. The HCA knows most about the actual physical-emotional state of the patient, but has little medical knowledge. The nurse checks the main inputs and outputs, but might neither get proper insights from the HCAs or the doctors. The doctors only see the medical notes with the daily reports, really. They only have filtered information. How do you see this problem?</em></p>\n<p>I think it varies. Where I trained it was all done through the electronic system. They would send you messages with instructions, but you might not communicate verbally with the doctors. In other wards where I have worked they really wanted doctors to talk directly to the nurses. Don’t just change something in the drug chart, talk to the nurse about it. For a while they tried whiteboard systems, where doctors would write things down outside patients’ rooms, but they gave that up. Because the doctors change so often, you just start to get into a routine with your doctor and they all move around again and you have to start from scratch. Little things, like, conversations between nurse and patient about their usual medication or changes in their wellbeing, are not passed on to the doctors.You have to challenge them sometimes. If they enter a patient’s room I tend to challenge them: who are you? They are often surprised that I ask. They might be specialists in this or that field, but I want to know what they are doing. If you have eight patients it is difficult to keep up with all these separate conversations. With less patients it is easier to catch what is going on. There is not really a formalised handover between door and nurse. There is only a ward round between doctors and multi-disciplinary staff and the nurse in charge, they go through each patient. The medical team might say the patient is fit for discharge, then the physios say they haven’t sorted the stairlift in the patient’s house yet. The nurse in charge gathers their information from the nurses during the day. There is no direct input from the bedside nurses. In intensive care or in the community this is different, there the nurses participate in these kinds of ward rounds.</p>\n<p><em>Question: Are you as a nurses sometimes asked to do things above your qualification level? And what would it mean if you say no? If I, as a HCA say no, then a nurse will have to do the job. What happens if you say no?</em></p>\n<p>Sure, I was asked as a newly qualified nurse to look after a patient with a tracheotomy, without having had the training. If you say no you open yourself up to pressure from your colleagues. Often it’s not a question of training or skills. They don’t really ask you to do things that you’re not trained for that much. But if a doctor asks me to take blood from a patient I can tell them that I will do it later in the day, showing them the list of tasks that I still have to do. If the doctor wants to get it done before the afternoon, they have to do it themselves. It is hard to handover a job to the nurse on the next shift though, you can get bad vibes, despite all the talk about 24-hour care and the fact that some tasks can wait. There is also no direct financial incentive to do extra training. It looks good on your CV, perhaps in that way there is, if you want to move up to Band 6. You can train as a HDU [High Dependency Unit) nurse, but that doesn’t mean that you get paid more. You just look after sicker patients, perhaps fewer of them.</p>\n<p><em>Question: The difference between HCAs and nurses is that we can’t hand out medication. The difference between nurse and doctor is that you can’t prescribe medication?</em></p>\n<p>Some nurses can, you have to go through a prescriber course. Then there are so-called ACPs, advanced clinical practitioner, that’s a masters course. Then you can diagnose and prescribe. You can essentially do what a junior doctor does. In a way it is similar to a nursing associate, basically a trained HCA who can do what we nurses do. There are some blurred roles.</p>\n<p><em>Question: Is there any collective behaviour regarding being understaffed?</em></p>\n<p>I remember during Covid we were understaffed, we had no people to re-stock equipment. Each time you needed something you had to leave the ward, taking all your PPE off. We wrote an incident report, saying that our staffing was not good enough and that is the impact it had on the patients and us. I am a big fan of putting in incident reports if the staffing is not right. That’s the only way that things are acknowledged. But the feedback we got was: “Every time you put one of these reports in, a nurse has to take the time out of their day to go through it, having less time to help on the ward.”</p>\n<p><em>Question: How easy is it at the moment to just get a different, less stressful job in the sector? That seems to be the main way that people deal with stress. Individually.</em></p>\n<p>There is definitely a, ‘let’s get out’ mentality. A lot of people working in the community wouldn’t go back to the hospital ward. Hospitals always prioritise the emergency departments or intensive care units when it comes to staffing. If you shout the loudest, you get something. I see Band 6 lead nurses tweaking patient reports a bit, showing them as sicker than they are, just in order to keep some staff on the ward. So that you wouldn’t have to send your own staff away to allegedly needier areas of the hospital.</p>\n<p><em>Question: What about the recruitment of overseas nurses, what kind of conditions do they face?</em></p>\n<p>There is one Trust that basically organises the recruitment for all Trusts in the wider region. They go out to Dubai, India, Philippines and do recruitment fairs, do local job interviews. Often nurses already know people here, former colleagues or family members who might also work in the sector. Nurses who arrive from the Philippines or India have a clause in their contract that says that they have to work for a Trust for three years or they will be asked to potentially pay back the recruitment costs. That’s pretty awful. British nurses who went to work in Saudi Arabia, in contrast, were offered a bonus if they stayed for a whole three years. Another problem they are facing is driving, having their driving license accepted. They get three months’ accommodation paid for, then they usually have trouble finding a place to rent. Every Trust has a different policy here. There is a grassroots organisation now that organises monthly Zoom meetings for foreign nurses, where they can share their experiences. They focus, amongst other things, on the issue of language, like, medical language. People might know English, but medical terms are a hurdle. A lot of foreign nurses get stuck on Band 5. They don’t get the training or support. During the pandemic they were often sent to work on Covid wards, over-proportionally often. There is a huge Philippino nurses network, they denounced this practice.</p>\n<p><strong>*** Response from a nurse in Germany</strong></p>\n<p>Hello,</p>\n<p>If I compare the report to my situation here at the University Clinic in Freiburg I see some differences. Here we have to bear in mind that the conditions at the 40 University Clinics in Germany differ a lot from conditions in the other 1,800 general hospitals.</p>\n<p><em>Drug rounds</em></p>\n<p>The general staffing level of 1:8 is more or less the same. But when it comes to drug rounds, they tried hard to ‘liberate’ nurses from the 1 to 2 hours that it takes to do the medication rounds by making the process more ‘lean’. On wards with a lot of standard medication e.g. on orthopaedic wards or post-accident surgery where people get their own medication plus pain relief, medication is prepared and allocated by machines (currently a test-run). The night-shift (two people for 25 to 30 patients) then controls the medication for the whole next day. On wards with more complex medication with a lot of day-to-day changes (pancreatic surgery, oncology) so-called medical-technical assistants (MTAs) prepare the oral medication – again, it’s the nurses on night-shift who double-check. So it tends to be a ‘two-pairs of eyes’ principle, when it comes to oral medication, which, according to my own experience, has lowered the rate of medication errors.</p>\n<p>On all wards one shift prepares all IVs for the following shift, meaning using the digital patient data to print the labels with barcodes, getting the IVs dosage from the ward cupboard etc., but the administering nurse does the final preparation. The trays with the day medication are distributed by the night-shift at 5am to patients’ rooms – unless patients have cognitive impairments. IVs and medications are administered in a three-shift system at fixed times (7am, 2pm, 8pm/10pm depending on medication). Even the pain relief has been mechanised during the last two years. There is a type of inhaler for the first three days after surgery, patients were able to self-administer a pre-fixed dosage at certain intervals. This turned out to be too expensive, or the consultants were not able to agree on a common system.</p>\n<p>To conclude, a lot of medication work has been taken away from the nurses / nurses have been ‘relieved’ from that work. Not everyone likes that, because administering medication is seen as a core task. From the point of view of the MTAs it is a very repetitive task, e.g. when two MTAs prepare the trays for 90 patients, using scissors to cut the right amount of pills still packaged, so that the nurse only has to pop them. It’s often two older women sitting in a room full of medication, on part-time, with a coffee-machine, doing just that.</p>\n<p><em>Division of labour</em></p>\n<p>There are two types of HCAs, the two year apprenticeship as a care assistant is the classic form. More and more people do that, because the three year apprenticeship to become a nurse is made more and more demanding, the exams become more difficult. Many people just want to finish after two years. When it comes to ward rotas, other people work as HCAs as well, such as volunteers, student nurses. Usually there is one HCA per ward. During the early shift there are additional MTAs for taking blood; during the evening and night shifts the nurse has to decide if she takes blood samples herself or asks the doctors/consultants to do it. Then there is a ‘Primary Nurse’ who hasn’t got patients, but deals with admissions and discharges etc. And a so-called ‘Care Expert’ who can be consulted with when it comes to complex questions that nurses are not familiar with. There is usually one ‘Care Expert’ for 6 to 8 wards. So in a way there are more people located around the nurse who do various tasks, there is a wider ‘skill mix’.</p>\n<p><em>Digitalisation</em></p>\n<p>For the last ten years we have been using digital documentation with direct links to the labs and all ‘diagnosis departments’ (imaging etc.). All professional groups have access to this data, using the ward computers. We used to discuss the consequences, in terms of more supervision and surveillance and in terms of what happens to the additional ‘free time’ that is created – will they squeeze more work in, use less people? Before the digitalisation the night-shift had to prepare or reproduce the analogue patient data, which was at least 1 to 2 hours work every night! So they can turn over more patients during the day-shift and need less women-hours during the night. When things were on paper, stuff was always ‘wandering around’ from doctor to diagnosis to nurse. You had to take ‘temporary notes’ or waste time finding the documents. In this sense it saves time. But you also have to sign with your name at any point of documentation.</p>\n<p><em>Other comments</em></p>\n<p>I don’t really come across situations where people don’t dare to say that they are not confident or trained to do certain tasks. Our three shifts are more or less the same length now. The handover has been reduced to 20 minutes. This used to be 1.5 hours, where you would actually have 30 minutes for handover, 30 minutes to chat and 30 minutes to go home earlier. I think we should ask less about the question of ‘what creates stress’, but the question of ‘how do you work together’ and ‘how can we use this to resist or fight for better conditions’.</p>\n"}}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
