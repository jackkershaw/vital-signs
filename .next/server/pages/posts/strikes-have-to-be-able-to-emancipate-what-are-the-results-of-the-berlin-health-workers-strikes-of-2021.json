It was also remarkable that the focus was not on wage levels but on the catastrophic staffing situation in the hospitals. For the first time, the workers of the two largest hospital operators Vivantes and Charité went on strike together for a relief collective agreement (addressing primarily the staff – patient ratio) and the application of the collective agreement for the public service (TVÖD) in the Vivantes subsidiaries. Ver.di, with dozens of organisers, set up different structures during the strike to motivate individual workers and actively involve them in the strike action. The result of the collective agreement was hailed from many sides. According to ver.di negotiator Melanie Guba, a “milestone of relief” was to be set with the collective agreement at the Charité. In contrast to previous collective agreements, the colleagues succeeded above all in obtaining either financial compensation or additional days off to compensate for the strain of understaffed shifts.</em></p>\n<p><em>What is the current situation on the wards? And what has remained of the dynamics of the strike for the workers? We talked about this with a nurse who has been employed at the Charité for over twenty years and has worked on various wards.</em></p>\n<p><em>A great documentary on recent health workers strikes in Germany can be found on <a href=\"https://de.labournet.tv/hoechstens-vier-wochen\">Labournet.tv</a>, unfortunately without English subtitles.</em></p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p><em>More than a year after the strike, what do things look like at work? Has the staff situation on individual wards really improved and has the agreement been implemented?</em></p>\n<p>There are definitely areas where the situation has improved. However, we also hear quite often that, as many of us expected, nothing has really improved in terms of relief through more staff in this quite short time. Recently, the press has mainly reported on the situation in the paediatric wards, because there, too, the agreed staff-to-patient ratio was implemented in almost none of the shifts. Colleagues in oncology, for example, report that about half of the beds have been closed in order to keep the ratio. Currently, colleagues from other countries are being recruited on a massive scale, which in turn brings its own problems and often leads to a different workload on the wards. Despite its locational advantage (attractive location, size), the Charité manages at best to compensate for the high turnover of nursing staff by recruiting new staff, but is not in a position to build up staff significantly. Nevertheless, the collective agreement should be seen as a certain relief. Previously, colleagues were usually told by their superiors that they had to organise themselves better, for example, when they indicated in a hazard report (Datix) that they felt overworked. This was simply dismissed as a subjective feeling. You don’t have to listen to that kind of nonsense anymore with the ratios that are automatically recorded. In addition, there are these ChEP points (Charité relief points). If the staff-patient ratio agreed in the collective agreement is not reached in a shift, the colleagues concerned each receive a ChEP. These, in turn, can be converted into days off to a limited extent or saved up. In this respect, what has been agreed is being implemented at the Charité. The commission that is supposed to determine staffing rules for areas not yet covered by the collective agreement is also working regularly. As far as we hear from the colleagues at Vivantes, they are experiencing far greater disappointments.</p>\n<p><em>Is it realistic that colleagues can really take their time off when they have accumulated the corresponding stress points, or does it only exist on paper?</em></p>\n<p>The Charité, wisely anticipating that many such relief days would arise, had it written into the collective agreement that their number would be limited. Thus, in 2022 only five relief days per registered or qualified staff could be claimed; in 2023 it is to be ten and in 2024 then fifteen. The ChEPs accrued over and above this can either be saved for a sabbatical, which lasts a maximum of three months, or for the colleagues to escape to retirement a few weeks earlier, subject to some bureaucratic requirements. To a degree limited by tax law, it is also possible to convert ChEPs into money. Personally, I do not find any of the latter options attractive. In these alternatives, unfortunately, the danger is inherent that superiors will be in your ear to save up points rather than convert them into days off. A certain amount of steadfastness is needed to enforce the days off. In order to counteract the pressure on staff that is intensified by this system, the Charité asks the nursing staff to work additional so-called ‘stability shifts’. Because they are very well paid, many colleagues actually do these shifts. This in turn leads to more disputes on the wards among colleagues. Many find it scandalous that work in additional shifts is suddenly supposed to be worth much more, and expect colleagues on stability duty to work more. On the other hand, it is always a point of contention whether, after having worked their additional stability shift, the colleagues are much more exhausted once they are back on their own ward. In addition to the additional duties, the Charité is thinking aloud about making working hours more flexible, such as extending shifts to twelve hours. Even more blatant is the attempt to get nursing staff who have found a job within the Charité that is no longer directly at the patient’s bedside to return to normal ward duty. They talk about demographic-friendly jobs, but they absolutely want to bring colleagues back into patient care who have found their niche with less physically demanding activities and without shift work for health or private reasons. The demand from the board of the Charité to more or less directly ban agency work in nursing also fits in with this. Because in nursing, temporary employment agencies often offer better working conditions and pay more. What the whole thing is supposed to have to do with relief remains a mystery. Moreover, the Charité can of course determine how many patients it admits for treatment. This is what is meant by the bed closures just mentioned, but there are of course limits to this, since the Charité is supposed to be profitable and closing beds is disadvantageous for patients, some of whom have to put up with longer waiting times. In this respect, it is not realistic to grant additional days off if the clinic wants to offer a similar service level. This would require an additional workload through the back door, especially in the form of stability shifts. Nevertheless, the days off are important as a kind of compensation for pain and suffering.</p>\n<p><em>You mentioned earlier that there are problems when colleagues are recruited from abroad. What does that mean exactly?</em></p>\n<p>For one thing, I think it’s a disgrace when rich Germany poaches trained professionals in nursing, especially since I assume that the guidelines set out in the UN are hardly ever adhered to. After all, nursing staff are not only recruited for German patients through state agreements, but clinics also do this on their own. The colleagues bring different language skills with them and have worked in other care models with a correspondingly different division of labour. This leads to misunderstandings time and again. They need training for quite a long time and have to improve their language skills alongside their work. In any case, it takes some time before the new colleagues are actually perceived as a relief.</p>\n<p><em>As you already mentioned, the collective agreements at Charité and Vivantes have been implemented very differently. What are the main differences?</em></p>\n<p>The collective agreements contain rather complicated regulations, some of which revolve around the fact that a software program automatically compares patient occupancy and the staff assigned to a ward. This software actually worked at the Charité at the start of the collective agreement. The management of the state-owned Vivantes group wanted to be particularly precise and introduce a system that recorded the ratio to the minute. One consequence was that no recording system existed at all until the summer of 2022. On the other hand, the minute-by-minute accounting ensured that in the times of handover, when, for example, the early duty nurses and the colleagues from the late duty are together on the ward, the ratios are suddenly fulfilled, but the colleagues start their actual work again a short time later clearly understaffed. Colleagues from Vivantes report that they are transferred at short notice from a regularly staffed shift to other wards in order to at least partially compensate for the shortage there. The areas specified in the collective agreement for which there were no ratios when the collective agreement on relief (TVE) was signed (for example, radiology and dialysis) are still being negotiated at Charité, but at Vivantes there seems to be a real standstill. The management of Vivantes is behaving like real arseholes towards the nursing staff, but compared to the way they treat the colleagues in the subsidiaries, it seems almost friendly.</p>\n<p><em>Both permanent staff and workers from the subsidiaries took industrial action together, but at the Vivantes subsidiaries the demand for a TVÖD (being paid like in the public sector) was in the foreground. According to the press, colleagues there are now voting with their feet en masse and quitting in the knowledge that they would earn more elsewhere. How do you assess the course of the very slow negotiations?</em></p>\n<p>The strike ended with a collective agreement for the subsidiaries that is based on the TVÖD and provides for gradual wage increases, but does not reach the wage level of the TVÖD. Moreover, not all subsidiaries are treated equally. But since the agreement Vivantes has been arguing with ver.di and withholding larger parts of their wages from the colleagues who are supposedly so valuable to them. Some bonuses have been cancelled without replacement. In addition, Vivantes is haggling over the wage grades and job evaluations. From the colleagues’ point of view, they are to be placed in wage groups that are too low. Apparently, Vivantes is also cancelling previously granted bonuses with the new grouping, for example in the area of cleaning. At the same time, Vivantes wants to divide the colleagues and is planning to put new staff in a lower group. As far as I know, the drama was not over by the end of 2022. This could well be Vivantes’ calculation, because without an agreement with ver.di, each colleague will have to sue for their rights individually.</p>\n<p><em>Would the strike have had to last longer to get the workers back into the parent company?</em></p>\n<p>The strike should definitely have been longer. Both the goals of relief and the introduction of the TVÖD for the subsidiaries had not yet been securely achieved. Nevertheless, it has to be said that the nursing staff were on strike for four weeks and the colleagues in the subsidiaries for another two weeks. That is quite exhausting. In addition, there was a collection to financially support the strikers at the subsidiaries, but of course the strike money does not completely compensate for the wages. Especially those who don’t have much in terms of reserves and savings have to think about how long a strike can last. My feeling was that, before the Charité signed the collective agreement, the strength of the colleagues would probably have been enough for a few more days of strikes, but with the signature the end was sealed. Whether the time would have been enough to negotiate a better collective agreement remains speculative. However, the colleagues apparently felt that not much more was possible and voted accordingly to suspend the strike.</p>\n<p><em>Is leaving the job currently the only form of protest? To what extent can these difficulties in implementation be used to push the struggles further?</em></p>\n<p>Yes, at the moment the protest is mainly expressed in the fact that the (often female) colleagues are leaving the subsidiaries. Since the collective agreement is based on the TVÖD, there is the possibility of taking joint industrial action again in the current round of collective bargaining, focusing on the issue of wage levels. Unfortunately, the collective agreements are drafted in such a way that the agreed wage increases would only ever reach the colleagues of the subsidiaries with a time lag. Nevertheless, my hope would be that this year’s round of collective bargaining will once again bring us together in large numbers on the streets and on strike, so that the common ground is not so quickly forgotten. Because for almost twenty years, politics and bosses have divided us nicely.</p>\n<p><em>In recent years, Ver.di has tried very hard to have a different form of member participation in the collective bargaining disputes. The keyword here is ‘strike university’ in the form of workshops for exchange and political discussions. Delegates and so-called ‘collective bargaining advisors’ (also a kind of team delegate) are appointed by the teams to accompany negotiations, they inform their teams and, in the best case, pass on the teams’ demands to ver.di. What do the colleagues think about the organisation of the strike and what has changed for them in the longer term as a result?</em></p>\n<p>Up until the collective bargaining movement, the union approached us with a top-down style, i.e. union officials set targets and the pace. With the collective bargaining advisors, a path was taken in which the active colleagues can get much more involved. This has actually led to a certain (participatory) dynamic in the wards. Ideally, the bargaining advisors were elected by their teams and the teams discussed the matter. In 2021, this went so far that the team delegates, as the former bargaining advisers are now called, accompanied the negotiations very closely and were continuously informed by the bargaining commission. I have the impression that this was perceived as a good thing by many and led to sustained activity on their own part. In preparation for the collective bargaining, many are more interested than usual and take part in meetings, even if not yet at the level of 2021. In this respect, something like a team delegate structure definitely makes sense. However, whether such a structure is sufficient to actively challenge decisions made by union officials cannot yet be judged conclusively. Moreover, I think it is normal that the structures that emerge in an industrial dispute crumble again afterwards. That was probably the case at the Charité.</p>\n<p><em>How did the colleagues experience the organisers and what remained of the dynamic that was created by them?</em></p>\n<p>Without the organisers, the strike would not have happened. Especially in the beginning they were necessary to activate the colleagues. They gained a position of trust, if only because they were always around and approachable. At the same time, the official organisers planned large parts of the campaign, including the election of team delegates, the big meetings, demonstrations, etc. All very important for the momentum to build up a campaign. All very important for the dynamics of tackling such a long strike. But in my eyes this has also meant that the team delegates have too rarely questioned decisions and proposed arrangements. In my opinion, it would have been better if the organisers had withdrawn a bit more after the initial phase, especially in questions of content, in order to give the colleagues more room for their own development. Strikes must emancipate. Organisers are employees of a company commissioned by ver.di. This means that there is always a danger that the bureaucratic levels of ver.di will exert a strong influence on the opinions of the colleagues through the organisers. When the organisers express opinions, they usually carry more weight than when a nurse speaks. Colleagues are not used to questioning things and often prefer to stay in the consumer role, at least in my experience. The team delegates are a good idea to break this up, but it hasn’t quite happened yet.</p>\n<p><em>Were there, or are there, attempts among the workers to organise independently beyond the trade union apparatus?</em></p>\n<p>I would say that there are very few such attempts nationwide. All the groups I know of are made up of very few people. This seems to me to be an expression of the problem I have just described.</p>\n<p><em>In the meantime, workers in more than twenty clinics nationwide have won collective agreements to reduce the workload. Do you have contacts in other cities and how are you networked?</em></p>\n<p>Yes, there are contacts. Networking is mainly done through ver.di or also through supporting groups outside the clinics such as the alliance “Health not Profits”. These contacts can certainly be expanded.</p>\n<p><em>How do you assess the strike support from the Berlin population and what would you wish for future disputes?</em></p>\n<p>Actually, we had the feeling that we had a very broad support within the Berlin population. That means, on the one hand, meetings with the so-called ‘city society’, in which a lot of people and also initiatives took part. At the same time, we have also received a lot of positive feedback and support from family, friends, patients and relatives. The last collective dispute was about relief and thus also about improving patient care. And everyone knows that they can quickly become a patient. In 2023, it is now about our wage level and an inflation adjustment. We know that many Berliners are in a similar or even worse financial situation than we are. That’s why we don’t want our wage demands to be seen as greedy. For us, they are the absolute minimum wage increase for all workers and aid recipients. We hope that there will be powerful joint actions, for example with the colleagues at the Berlin municipal cleaning service, to push through our demands, and that the Berlin population will also take to the streets with us.</p>\n<p><em>In October 2022, the doctors at the Charité also went on strike. What were the connections to the relief movement for better staffing ratios and what about the solidarity between different professional groups?</em></p>\n<p>The doctors at the Charité have their own collective agreement through the Marburger Bund. In principle, the relationship between doctors and nurses is difficult as far as collective bargaining is concerned. On the one hand, due to the observation that the wage demands of the doctors’ colleagues have been met in recent years even without industrial action à la “doctors don’t have to strike”. On the other hand, during our strike for better staffing ratios, many a chief physician or senior physician attracted negative attention by putting pressure on the nursing staff to perform better than was possible due to the strike emergency staffing. Last year, the doctors demanded not only more pay but above all better working conditions, and here we would actually have an overlap, because both their and our working conditions are so unbearable because of the flat rates per case-system (hospitals receive a fixed amount for each individual treatment, which is supposed to motivate them to do it as efficient as possible). There is a lot of understanding on the part of the nursing staff for the demands of the assistant doctors, but unfortunately this is rarely expressed in actual solidarity among the individual nursing staff. At the same time, it has to be said that the solidarity among the occupational groups that maintain a clinic could, on the whole, be better.</p>\n<p><em>What do you expect for the upcoming collective bargaining dispute as far as the motivation of your colleagues is concerned?</em></p>\n<p>The pressure is very high because of the increased cost of living, so I hope that the colleagues are properly motivated. However, there are already fears among the colleagues that the bargaining committee will be satisfied with too little or that the employers will take refuge in arbitration. In contrast to the collective bargaining relief movement, this is now a nationwide collective agreement and experience shows that there is less direct influence from the ward-floors. This could also have a negative effect on the motivation of the colleagues. We will have to wait and see. The next strike day is on 9 February. Many colleagues have already made it clear that they want to take to the streets for their demands.</p>\n"},"posts":{"edges":[{"node":{"title":"Learning from health workers in Argentina – On the current rebellion in Neuquén","excerpt":"<p>What started as a health workers’ dispute has turned into a regional uprising.

But they have found ways to make themselves heard. Read more about this below. If you are interested in discussing our situation as health workers and the current pay campaign, get in touch: vitalsignsmag@proton.me</em></p>\n<p>What started as a health workers’ dispute has turned into a regional uprising. Since early March, health workers throughout the province of Neuquén in Argentina have been staging unofficial strikes and roadblocks, demanding a pay rise higher than the miserable deal agreed by the government and the unions. They also demanding better working conditions to face what is expected to be the second wave of coronavirus in Argentina. The health system is not up to the task. Increased layoffs of critical care nurses and emergency paramedics over the past year have exacerbated staffing shortages. This dispute has turned into a bigger movement, and a self-organised one at that. Workers have been setting up a strike fund and holding open meetings at the hospital entrances. After being ignored, the movement has escalated their tactics by using roadblocks to obstruct the province’s oil and gas production.</p>\n<div class=\"wordads-ad-wrapper\">\n<div id=\"atatags-26942-851726\" data-adtags-width=\"740\"><strong>Background of the dispute</strong></div>\n</div>\n<p>In December 2019, the provincial government froze public sector wages. This meant a 26% loss of purchasing power for health sector workers in the midst of the 2020 pandemic. The vaccination campaign, which began in early 2021, is slow to get off the ground while Argentina is caught up in the second wave of the pandemic.</p>\n<p><strong>Why has it kicked off now?</strong></p>\n<p>On February 24th this year, the provincial government offered a 12% wage increase to health workers. On February 25th, the union’s grassroots assemblies in about 20 hospitals and health centres rejected this proposal. Union General Secretary Carlos Quintriqueo ignored this vote, and on Feb. 26th, the union leadership accepted the government’s deal. This fierce betrayal of union (ATE) representatives was the straw that broke the camel’s back.</p>\n<p>On March 2nd, a large inter-hospital meeting of health workers was held in the centre of Neuquén, the provincial capital. They decided to demand that wage negotiations be resumed, a 40% increase for 2020 and an adjustment in line with inflation for 2021. They also decided to coordinate their demands with the teachers’ union, ATEN, and to draw up a joint action plan. ATEN had rejected the same wage proposal a few days earlier, and decided not to resume classes on March 3rd.</p>\n<p>At the same time, various conflicts were spreading in the region. Social movements blocked rural road bridges and other points for an increase in support programs; schools throughout the province made demands of the state; and the feminist movement took to the streets against the femicide of Guadalupe Curual in Villa La Angostura. On March 10th, self-organized health workers, opposition to the ATEN union leadership, other public sector workers, workers in the self-managed tile factories, and social movements came together in a demonstration that ended at the main government building. On March 12th, health workers with the union of justice workers (SEJUN) blocked the bridges between Neuquén and Cipolletti. Meanwhile, ATEN maintained a protest camp in front of the government building. There was still no response from the political side.</p>\n<p>On March 16th, the provincial government agreed to add 3% to the wage increase, for a total of 15%. At the same time, the health workers rehearsed a first blockade of the oil route, the roads through which the project of Vaca Muerta is carried out. (Vaca Muerta is an oil shale deposit where they’re fracking). The government continued to refuse to meet with the self-organized workers. ATEN’s union leadership pushed through the approval of the wage proposal, even though it meant a significant loss of wages. On the same day, the Cerámica Neuquén tile factory (which had been taken over by the workers*) was again threatened with eviction and auction.</p>\n<p>On March 24th, (the anniversary of the 1976 coup), thousands again took to the streets. In addition to the usual demands for commemoration, truth and justice, health was big on peoples’ agenda, demonstrating the broad legitimacy health workers now had amongst the wider population. More roadblocks, this time to famous tourist destinations, resulted in more clashes. The traffic chaos and growing criticism of a continued lack of response from the government emboldened health sector workers to expand their struggle further.</p>\n<div class=\"wordads-ad-wrapper\">\n<div id=\"atatags-26942-551511\" data-adtags-width=\"740\"><strong>Oil and gas blockades</strong></div>\n</div>\n<p>The Neuquén area is known for its oil and gas industry. On April 7th, a series of indefinite blockades began at strategic points along the oil route, focussing on Añelo, the neuralgic centre of Vaca Muerta. Through the roadblocks, workers have been mainly targeting the trucks transporting fuel from the Vaca Muerta refinery, while letting the rest of the drivers pass. The blockades have made it difficult to drill new wells, forcing the closure of smaller wells, and causing problems at processing plants that threaten Buenos Aires’ gas supply.</p>\n<p>As the government continued its silence, the number of blockades increased to twelve by April 10th. For the last two weeks, 30 roadblocks have paralysed the activities of the petroleum industry in Vaca Muerta.</p>\n<p>In parallel, a meeting was convened with social movements, unions, parties and local organizations in the city of Neuquén at the Castro Rendón Hospital, the largest hospital in the province. A few hours after this meeting, the state energy company of the province, EPEN, cut off the electricity to the worker-run Zanon-FaSinPat tile factory.</p>\n<p>At first, the authorities had maintained that pay rise negotiations would only take place with the unions and refused to meet with the strikers. Finally, after weeks of unofficial actions, the provincial government agreed to meet the protestors but after a couple of meetings, which the workers considered unproductive and a waste of their time, they decided to leave the negotiation table until there was an acceptable pay rise proposal from the government.</p>\n<p><em>“We left our answer on the table and told them that we are not going to accept any more teasing, as they did yesterday (Friday 16th) when they kept us for 9 hours in sterile discussions. When they have a proposal for an increase in the basic pay, they can call us and we will sit down to discuss it. In the meantime we will continue to hold roadblocks and deepen the measures.”</em> said one of the representatives of the workers, after last Saturday’s meeting.</p>\n<p>Throughout all this, the Mapuche communities in the Añelo area have been joining the pickets. The situation with the truck drivers has gone from conflicts and counter-pickets to solidarity. Workers have joined in solidarity and stayed outside the Ciudad Judicial where the negotiation meetings were held.<br />\nMeanwhile, almost all the union leaders not only do not support the strike but even openly attack it, like the leader of ATE Neuquén. The union leaders aligned with the Kirchner government, who went so far as to consider that it should be repressed, forcing all the sectional delegates to sign this declaration, which some of them denounced.</p>\n<p>Despite the position of the union leaders, on the roads and in the streets of Neuquén, there is massive participation of health workers and massive support of teachers, as well as the active support of various militant unemployed movements. In addition, most of the oil workers and truck drivers appear to be getting closer to the health workers, despite the significant physical and monetary wear and tear that being stranded on the roads causes them on a daily basis. Some helped to block supply products for fracking, and have been maintaining food supplies.</p>\n<p>Last week ended with a strike by the teachers’ union ATEN and the judiciary union SEJUN, which issued a joint statement with various unions at the Universidad del Comahue. It was a strike in solidarity with the health sector. The union leaders, under pressure from their own rank and file and large public support, could no longer stay out of it.</p>\n<div class=\"wordads-ad-wrapper\">\n<div id=\"atatags-26942-963534\" data-adtags-width=\"740\">In a recent statement, the workers declared that: <em>¨(…) In the face of any offer from the government, it will be the assemblies of the hospitals and health centres, including the comrades who are on the different picket lines on the routes, who will decide whether to accept or reject it. If our rebellion was because a group of leaders decided on a miserable increase behind our backs, it will continue to be the rank and file who will decide the next steps. We call on the workers in each hospital and health centre to continue fighting for our decent pay and working conditions to continue in the front line of care for the population in this pandemic and the community to continue to support us.¨</em></div>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Effects of the uprising so far… </strong></p>\n<p>The management tried to get oil workers to denounce health workers. Without success. The contractors complain about losses of millions. But the health workers’ struggle has also revealed that oil companies are raking in millions in profits every day. Another success of the ‘elephants’ (that’s what the health workers call their movement).</p>\n<p><em>“We work in conditions of overwork and overtiredness. We’ve had to maintain daily operations, with a lack of materials and rudimentary equipment.” Since early March 2021, the staff of the Centenario Hospital in the Argentine city of Neuquén has been on strike against planned austerity measures. The women are at the forefront of this. They are fighting against deteriorating working conditions and trying to make up for the loss of childcare in the pandemic.

Why did you resort to this method and not walk out ‘normally?’</em></p>\n<p>Mira: The idea came from ver.di. So far, the paperwork strike has only taken place within the emergency services. Since it is almost impossible to go on strike when you work in emergency rescue services, another method was sought to draw the employer’s attention to the grievances and to strike without suggesting to the population that human lives could be in danger. This is the best method for us. After all, we don’t want to harm the population by not manning a rescue vehicle, but to put pressure on the employer – so we work and are thus entitled to wages, but the employer doesn’t get any money from those who pay for the services. By the way, we now talk about ‘billing strike’ instead of paperwork strike, because we don’t want to give the impression that we are only ‘striking on paper’.</p>\n<p><em>What are the important issues? What are you demanding?</em></p>\n<p>Dirk: In general, better wages, working hours and workplace arrangements. For example, it is always an issue that not all working hours are paid in the rescue service. Nationwide, it is common that for twelve hours worked, only 9.75 hours are paid. This means that every full-time employee in the rescue service works more than two hours ‘on a voluntary basis’ for every service each day. Under collective bargaining agreements, this is called ‘extended working time’ – legally, the employer thus circumvents the payment of ‘on-call time’, which would have to be considered working time according to rulings by the Federal Labor Court and the EU Court of Justice. For the first time in the 2018 collective bargaining dispute, we decided to go on a paperwork strike.</p>\n<p><em>And how does such a ‘billing strike’ work?’ How is it different from a ‘normal strike?’ How much courage do you need to participate in a paperwork strike?</em></p>\n<p>Dirk: In a paperwork strike in the ambulance service, everything that concerns billing is omitted. Normally, after a rescue or emergency operation, the data of the operation (location, transport destination, crew) with the data of the patient (name, address, health insurance, etc.) are sent to the billing office. A so-called transport bill is enclosed for this purpose. This certificate confirms that the transport has been carried out and thus provides the basis for billing. However, this ‘office activity’ is not actually in the paramedic’s or ambulance crew’s original job description. To refuse to perform this activity means that insurers aren’t billed, therefore they don’t pay out, and the DRK doesn’t get reimbursed.</p>\n<p>Mira: I don’t think it takes that much courage, it just takes everyone sticking together and participating. I think it would be harder to have a strike by not staffing a rescue operation than just not billing.</p>\n<p><em>How does the employer respond to that? What are their strategies?</em></p>\n<p>Dirk: The employers are always trying to stop industrial action with targeted intimidation. In the last but one round of collective bargaining, the employer openly communicated that in the event of a strike, payment claims against the striking workers could be expected and that everyone should think carefully about whether they would take this on themselves.</p>\n<p>Mira: In a well-organised company, a paperwork strike like this can quickly cause tens of thousands of Euros in damage, and employers naturally don’t like that. Here it is always good and important that we know that our union is on our side and that it informs our colleagues about reaction strategies and our rights during a strike.</p>\n<p><em>Even in a paperwork strike, it’s about acting together. How do you organise the collective momentum, which gives the individual the necessary courage? How do you arrange going on strike? Who knows when they do what and why?</em></p>\n<p>Mira: Yes, of course everyone has to participate. There are a lot of us in the union, so that’s not a problem. We do a lot of group chats and talk to each other personally. Everyone explains to the others what it’s about and how they feel about it. And when it’s not a pandemic, we meet with our union secretary and discuss what we need and how we can move forward together.</p>\n<p><em>Is this method transferable to other areas? What positive or negative experiences with the strike and the organisation or reactions have you had with it that you would like to pass on to other colleagues?</em></p>\n<p>Dirk: You mustn’t lose sight of the fact that this method is the most effective in bringing employers to their knees. Since workers don’t stop work, they continue to be paid in full and all other operating expenses continue as well. But the incoming flow of money is interrupted. So, it’s possible that an employer is driven into bankruptcy quite quickly. Those most responsible for strikes, like union reps or shop stewards should, if in doubt, always keep an eye on this situation and intervene in time.</p>\n<p>Mira: I’m just imagining, for example, if a waiter goes on strike by bringing the food to the guest, but never issues a bill afterwards. Well, our employer was not very pleased, neither by the strike nor by the actions themselves. They’ve been used to their employees never raising their voices for years, but they have been doing so more and more often and louder and louder in recent years. In my opinion, the employers are also dealing with this in the wrong way. They make us look as if we have outrageous demands instead of finally valuing these professions more. What is very positive and resonates far and wide is the cohesion amongst us and the feeling that we can achieve something together.</p>\n"}},{"node":{"title":"“We don’t need applause, we need change!” – Interview with a striking nurse in Berlin","excerpt":"<p>On the 23rd of August 2021, workers of the Berlin hospitals Charité and Vivantes went on a three-day warning strike.

You can read this article to understand the wider context. Despite various limitations, e.g. a strike participation of only around 20% (also due to legal emergency cover), we can still learn a lot from our fellow workers in Berlin – in preparation for future disputes here in the health sector in the UK.</em></p>\n<p><em>Original article <a href=\"https://communaut.org/de/wir-brauchen-keinen-applaus-sondern-veraenderung\">here</a></em></p>\n<p>——</p>\n<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>\n<p>On the 23rd of August 2021, workers of the Berlin hospitals Charité and Vivantes went on a three-day warning strike. The strike included the outsourced service workers at Vivantes. This was preceded by an ultimatum of 100 days, which the Berlin Hospital Movement (an alliance of initiatives and unions) had issued to the Senate (local government) and the employers of the state-owned hospitals on the 12th of May. The trade union demanded a serious offer concerning staffing levels, so-called ‘relief’, and pay and conditions according to the collective agreement for the public sector (TVöD) for all employees of the outsourced subsidiaries. The Senate and employers let the time pass unused – the health workers made good on their announcement and went on strike. Vivantes initially had the walkout banned by a temporary injunction from the labour court. The reason given: The medical care of patients was not secured because no emergency service agreement had been settled between Vivantes and Ver.di (the responsible trade union) in the run-up to the strike. However, the injunction was overturned a short time later at the labour court, and the walkout at Vivantes could begin.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, it is clear that the strikes will continue. Today (6th of September 2021) Ver.di published the results of a strike ballot: about 98% of the union members at Charité and Vivantes voted for further work stoppages.</p>\n<p>These latest disputes continue a long-standing movement for more staff and relief at the hospitals. The struggles at Charité played a pioneering role in this (for the history, see the Ver.di brochure “If there are more of us it is better for all”). Following on from the Berlin experience, a movement for a collective ‘relief’ contract, which would allow for better staffing ratios, also formed in the region of Saarland from 2017 onwards. In these movements, strikes were held on the basis of emergency service agreements in which the employer was given responsibility for patient safety. Another novelty was the model of ‘collective bargaining advisors’ or team delegates. These delegates, which are supposed to be in close contact with the team nature of day-to-day work, should create a strong feedback loop between the collective bargaining process and the ran-and-file on the shop-floor.</p>\n<p>We talked with Anja Voigt about the latest struggles. Anja is an intensive care nurse at Vivantes, involved in the Berlin alliance “Health not Profits”, Ver.di member and part of the collective bargaining commission.</p>\n<p>———</p>\n<p><em>Communaut: Before you went on strike, you gave the senate and the employers a hundred-day ultimatum so that they would make you an offer for a collective agreements. Since there was no movement at all on their part, you now went on a three-day warning strike. How did you decide to use the ultimatum as a means of struggle?</em></p>\n<p>Our thought behind it was that the time was ripe for a renewed fight, since nursing and the hospital have received a certain amount of public attention through Corona. In addition, in September there is the election for the House of Representatives in Berlin. So the months from May to September were a good timeline to put pressure on politicians. If we simply stood up and demanded a collective agreement on relief, probably no one would have noticed. That’s why we tied the demand for a new collective agreement to an ultimatum, saying, “If serious negotiations don’t start by the end of the ultimatum, we’re going on strike.”</p>\n<p><em>Did the idea of the ultimatum come more from the union side or from the workers?</em></p>\n<p>The idea came more from the union, but really only the idea. A lot of colleagues were involved in the whole implementation, who in turn asked their colleagues: “Do we want to do this? Is this something that can bring us success?” The idea alone would not have been enough. When we asked our colleagues if they would take part in industrial action, they were beating down our doors. They were really up for it. The pressure on health workers is now so great and it’s clear to everyone that things can’t go on like this in Berlin’s hospitals.</p>\n<p><em>Does that mean that there is currently a high level of support for the demands and a high level of participation in the strike?</em></p>\n<p>Yes, there is a very high level of support. We started with a petition to find out whether our colleagues wanted to take part and whether the demands were important to them. More than 8,500 colleagues signed the petition. The approval of the demands for relief (better staffing levels) was also clear in the last TvöD (collective contract for the public sector) negotiations in October, when Ver.di asked what we would like to see negotiated. It emerged that many colleagues are no longer interested in a pay increase, but in more staff. More money is nice, of course, but it doesn’t solve the current problems. On the contrary, the current workload is causing more and more people to leave the nursing profession. In order to stop this, fundamental changes must finally be made.</p>\n<p><em>How do you organise yourselves on the hospital level and, above all, between the various hospitals?</em></p>\n<p>Initially I was unsure if a simultaneous struggle in two hospitals would work. I had doubts about whether it could work. Vivantes alone has nine different locations, the hospital campus is vast, while Charité has three large complexes. Nevertheless, we wanted to bundle our demands and develop a joint movement. I have to say, it’s working brilliantly. Social media are wonderful for such purposes, especially telegram channels, etc. We are much better networked today than we were during the collective bargaining disputes two years ago, which is really impressive. I suddenly know colleagues from the Benjamin Franklin Hospital or from Spandau with whom I had never been in contact before. Now we know each other and are aware of each other’s problems. The greater networking also leads to enormous cohesion between the colleagues, which of course also makes us stronger. I haven’t experienced that in recent years – and I’ve really been active in the union for a long time. A really strong movement has emerged. You can also see this in the fact that – albeit slowly – small success are becoming visible. We can move a lot due to the size that we have now.</p>\n<p><em>Is your networking ‘only’ digital or do you also meet in person?</em></p>\n<p>Of course we also meet in person. That’s very important for the exchange of ideas. But it’s striking how much easier communication has become thanks to social media: In the past, if there was something important to communicate that affected everyone, in the worst case we would write a newsletter. It would then be on the road for half a week until it reached the last area. Some people didn’t receive the information until 14 days later. Today, you send something to the telegram group and 5,000 people know about it immediately, which is a great relief and makes union work much more interesting for me, because you can reach so many people so quickly. That’s really fun.</p>\n<p><em>How did you come up with your demands, is it more top-down? Are they Ver.di demands or do they come from below through your networking?</em></p>\n<p>No, it’s not top-down at all, quite the opposite, it starts at the bottom. We have started – very laboriously – to talk to every single colleague. In their teams and on their wards, colleagues asked other colleagues. In this way, each colleague conducted a so-called demand interview, in which they were asked what their work situation was like, what was stressing them, what was needed to improve the situation, what was needed to reduce the workload, and how many staff would be needed to do a good job and to be able to care for patients well. We then gradually bundled the demands that were mentioned in the hundreds of interviews and used them to draw up systematic demands. Nothing was dictated from above.</p>\n<p><em>For some years now, Ver.di has had a system of team delegates for labour disputes, here in Berlin and beyond. Can you describe how this works? Do workers have more of a say vis-à-vis the union leadership than before? How do you see the relationship between union activists and Ver.di in general? Ver.di has not always covered itself with glory in the past – for example, during the Charité strike.</em></p>\n<p>This is now a very broad and democratic process. What I have just described with regard to the demands also applies to the feedback from the other side. You can think of it roughly like this: A ward has about one to three team delegates, depending on its size. On the one hand, these team delegates maintain the connection to the collective bargaining commission, i.e. directly to the main Ver.di office, and on the other hand they feed all the information back to their team. It is no longer just one person from each hospital building who sits on the collective bargaining committee and has to establish a flow of information to the entire workforce, but there is now a direct link between ward teams and the main office. For example, we have a meeting of the collective bargaining committee today and afterwards, at 5 p.m., there is a Zoom meeting with all team delegates from Vivantes and Charité. We then report to everyone what happened today and what we have planned. The team delegates then have the opportunity to give us feedback. So it’s not just a one-sided address from us and then the meeting is over. If the team delegates say they don’t agree with what we agreed to in the bargaining committee, then we don’t do that either. We don’t even make important decisions without this feedback.</p>\n<p>This system of team delegates makes a lot of the female colleagues feel more involved. They no longer have the feeling: “Now we’re back to collective bargaining and Ver.di will say what’s going to happen, and then we’ll stand there with a flag and go on a warning strike and it’ll be fine.” Instead, they have the feeling that what is important to them also reaches the union and is negotiated directly. It’s about their needs and the needs of their patients on the ward. That’s what makes this movement so special.</p>\n<p><em>You are currently fighting two battles at Vivantes at the same time: On the one hand, the nursing staff fights for the collective ‘relief’ agreement. On the other hand, the outsourced workers of the Vivantes subsidiaries fight for the integration into the collective agreement for the public sector (TVöD). How did you manage to combine the two struggles? That’s sometimes a difficult thing to do.</em></p>\n<p>Yes, that’s incredibly difficult, especially to make sure that the struggle remains simultaneous. But it was important to us from the very beginning to make clear that we are one hospital and that everyone in this hospital works together. That’s teamwork. The nurse is no better than the cleaner, the handyman or maintenance person no less important than the radiographer. Only together can we provide good patient care. It’s really special that we’ve managed to bring so many people with different demands along with us. At the moment, the nursing staff is fighting for a collective agreement to reduce the workload, the subsidiary workers would finally like to be paid fairly, and yet we are fighting together. We also hold joint collective bargaining committee meetings and exchange information together digitally. When the management of the subsidiary company comes up with a new offer to negotiate, we are invited to join in and discuss it: “You want to go on strike now, it doesn’t really suit us right now, but we can support you.” That’s always a very productive exchange. I find it very inspiring. It creates a close cohesion within the hospital. Suddenly you say hello to the cleaning staff early in the morning, who you didn’t even notice before. I also find it impressive that at the strike demonstration last week, colleagues spontaneously took to the stage and spoke in front of 1,000 people who no one else would have noticed. All of a sudden they are visible in their function and position.</p>\n<p><em>Can you assess how the willingness to fight has changed as a result of Corona? Have you noticed any changes compared to before?</em></p>\n<p>This bad situation in the hospitals existed before Corona, of course, but it has become even worse, the workload has increased further. In addition, there is the factor that I mentioned earlier: We got more attention and publicity because of Corona. It makes the fight easier when you know that many people and the general public are behind us. I also believe that the willingness to fight has increased again as a result of the stupid applause. Many of us felt fooled by it and now say, “You can stop the nonsense, we really want a change now and now we’re going to do something.”</p>\n<p><em>At the Charité, and also at other public hospitals, the strikes of the past years were based on the regulation of a so-called emergency service agreement. This plays a relatively important role in the enforcement and organisation of strikes in hospitals, and in your case there has even been a court case. Can you explain what exactly an emergency service agreement is and how it comes about?</em></p>\n<p>The concept of the emergency service agreement was first developed during the big Charité strike in 2015. Until then, there were virtually no strikes in hospitals. Maybe people from reception occasionally engaged in symbolic pickets but otherwise it was always said: “We can’t go on strike because our patients won’t be cared for.” This led to great frustration among hospital workers. As a result, the union at the Charité came up with the emergency service agreement system. With this agreement, the union gives the employer sufficient notice that they want to strike. The employer is then responsible for ensuring patient care. To put it bluntly, the emergency service agreement says to the employer: “We won’t be on the ward tomorrow morning, so make sure that there are fewer patients.” This makes it possible to delegate responsibility to the employer, which is why this emergency service agreement is so important. In the meantime, hundreds of such agreements have been concluded in many hospitals in Germany. In the meantime, however, it is no longer quite so easy to enforce. In the past, it was a matter of settling an emergency service agreement for three warning strike days. Today, and especially in Berlin, we are no longer talking about just three days. The employer also knows that and naturally says, “No, not with us.” It is no longer enough to simply indicate that we will walk out. There are now negotiations back and forth and in the end the employers don’t want to settle for an emergency service agreement. But then we go on strike anyway because it’s our right and we have an emergency service agreement in place that we abide by. This means that our patients are not at risk. This has now also been confirmed to us in court in the current dispute.</p>\n<p><em>At the beginning of this warning strike, Vivantes first managed to enforce a ban on strikes by means of a temporary injunction. What would you say was the strategy behind that?</em></p>\n<p>The employer’s strategy was quite simply to prevent the strike. But it didn’t work; on the contrary, it backfired for Vivantes. During those three days, the willingness to fight grew even more because people were angry. The employer shot themselves in the foot, and I don’t think they expected this. We were proven right. It was also very important to many colleagues that we were not deprived of our basic rights just because we work in a hospital, but that it is clear that you can also strike responsibly in a hospital. It also annoys me in the public debate when people act as if we were irresponsible. None of my colleagues walks out, drops everything and we’re gone. We always check to see if someone else is there to do the necessary work. And we agree: “If you stay, I’ll go out, tomorrow we’ll do it the other way around.” That goes without saying. We took on so much responsibility in the Corona crisis, we didn’t run away. Of course, we won’t do the same in the event of a strike.</p>\n<p><em>When the strike at Vivantes was hanging in the balance, did you discuss among yourselves what you would do to get around it if the strike ban remained in place?</em></p>\n<p>The first moment the order was announced, we were all shocked. Then we quickly regrouped and thought about what we would do now. It was clear to us very quickly that Vivantes would not be able to get this emergency injunction through. A judge had decided that in a rush, but we knew that we had a good emergency service agreement and that we would get justice in court. And with this conviction that we would win, we went to court and won.</p>\n<p><em>The managing director of Vivantes, Johannes Danckert, likes to emphasise that he is also in favour of relief agreements, but that one hospital alone can’t do anything and that more money and, above all, political solutions are needed at the state or federal level. How would you answer him?</em></p>\n<p>I would tell him that he is absolutely right. The hospital financing system urgently needs to be reformed. Political solutions are needed, no question about it. We’re all with him on that, and we’ll also join him in the streets to demonstrate for that. But in the current situation, it’s up to Berlin’s state politicians, and we’re putting just as much pressure on them as we are on the management. We are always told by the management that they can’t decide anything and that the money has to come from politics. But we talk to them just as we talk to our management. As a city, as the capital of the Federal Republic of Germany, we have to think about whether we want to provide good services of general interest, healthcare that is fair to everyone, patients and employees alike. If you want that, then you have to spend money on it.</p>\n<p><em>Now there is an emergency service agreement. How many employees were ultimately able to take part in the warning strikes and demonstrations?</em></p>\n<p>There were 2,000 people at the strike demonstration on Wednesday. That was very impressive. There is still no emergency service agreement that Vivantes would have accepted. There is one that we say is good, that the employer could sign at any time – but they don’t, although it has also been confirmed in court. Nevertheless, many colleagues can go on strike with this emergency service agreement. I can’t give exact figures now, but certainly half of the colleagues were able to take part in the strike.</p>\n<p><em>Only nurses and other staff went on strike: what is your impression of the doctors? Do they support your demands and the strike?</em></p>\n<p>It always depends on the level of the hierarchy. The assistant doctors, i.e. the medical colleagues who work directly with us, see our daily misery and therefore support the strike. There is even a medical petition that many doctors have signed – including chief physicians or senior physicians, i.e. people in management. They also know that they cannot fully occupy their beds because there are not enough nursing staff. They don’t often say this so openly because they are also under financial pressure and sit in management positions. One question that always gets me is why we don’t all get together, from the nurses to the head physician – or even the management – and put our foot down and say: “This simply can’t go on any longer. Something is financially sick in Germany’s hospitals.” We still have to get that together.</p>\n<p><em>In Berlin, there is also a lot going on, also outside of the hospitals. The railway workers, who also work in the public sector, have gone on strike; at the delivery service Gorillas, there were so-called wildcat strikes recently; there are protests against the expansion of the autobahn – are there mutual references and solidarity between these struggles?</em></p>\n<p>Yes, there are solidarities. Just a short while ago, we were at the AWO (charity and big care employer) workers’ strike with our collective bargaining committee. Colleagues from the GDL (train drivers union) visited our strike. We are networked among ourselves and there is support everywhere. Sometimes it seems to me that a lot is happening here this summer. In Berlin, people are setting out to fight for a better city.</p>\n<p><em>During the first Corona wave, there was a lot of talk about care work and the poor working conditions. Do you feel that there is more solidarity and understanding for your demands from society than during labour struggles before the pandemic?</em></p>\n<p>In my perception, people have always had understanding. They just could never understand how you can go on strike in a hospital. Many were afraid that we would simply leave the patients behind. I think something has actually changed. For example, when I was standing in front of the hospital’s strike picket during the warning strike, an elderly couple came up to me and said, “It’s right that you’re on strike, that’s a good thing. They canceled my X-ray appointment, but that’s just the way it is.” I have the impression that the population knows that something has to change. People also understand that they have to actively fight for change and can’t always just start a petition. They understand that sometimes you might have to confront people head on in order to change something. Then a medical appointment might have to be postponed sometimes.</p>\n<p><em>Now you have carried out the warning strike. What do you think, will the hospital management come to the negotiating table? And will the workers vote for an indefinite strike in the ballot on Monday?</em></p>\n<p>In any case, you can see that our pressure has been successful and that something is moving. In a meeting with Vivantes management today, they used the word “negotiation” for the first time. That’s more than they did three weeks ago. It’s still not concrete, because the management hasn’t made any proposals yet, but at least they are now signalling their willingness to sit down at the table with us. But we need to keep up the pressure. We can’t let up now, we have to step it up a notch if we really want to achieve a positive result. I am very sure that the ballot will be positive and I assume that around 90 percent will vote in favour of a strike.</p>\n<p><em>The demands that were at stake during the ultimatum and the strike concern collective bargaining issues. However, there are a number of demands that go beyond this, for example in the ‘Health not Profits’ alliance, in which you are also involved – such as the abolition of the fee-per-case system and your demand for a solidarity-based healthcare system without profit logic. What could such a healthcare system look like and what would have to happen for it to actually be implemented in practice?</em></p>\n<p>There would have to be a different financing system. In the entire health sector, both in hospitals and in outpatient services, rehabilitation facilities, nursing homes, etc., the focus should not be on competition and profits, as is currently the case. No fire department, no school, no library has to make a profit, why then in the care of the sick? Something is ethically wrong. What is needed should be financed. If I’m sick, I need treatment, and that needs to be fully financed. The state must pay for this financing. We would not deny that it is also possible to work economically. But care must not be linked to whether an operation is particularly lucrative, and it should therefore not be prioritised over other cases. It cannot be the case that financial considerations determine how one is treated. We still have good medical care in Germany, but profit orientation absolutely must be abolished. Nor can taxpayers’ money and health insurance contributions be used to finance a system in which, in the end, some shareholders can pocket profits. That is crazy.</p>\n<p><em>Do you think that such a health care system is possible within a capitalist society? Many people say that housing should not be a commodity – and why should food be a commodity? But in fact, almost everything around us is a commodity. Do you think that a needs-based supply is possible within this logic and that the state will simply step into the breach?</em></p>\n<p>I’m quite sure of that, because that’s how it was in Germany until 2003. Until then, at least, the hospital financing system was not based on competition, but on need. Of course, there was a lot of corruption and abuse of power. But at least no hospital had to make a profit and be in the black. If the will is there, it is possible to turn this around again, perhaps not overnight, but as a trend. Even within the German Hospital Association (DKG), there are already such efforts. It is also clear to them that things can no longer go on as they are now.</p>\n<p><em>Another of the alliance’s demands is an equal distribution of care work between the sexes, whether private or professional, instead of cementing it as a task for women and families. Could you elaborate on what you mean by that exactly?</em></p>\n<p>In our society, it’s clear who provides care: 70 percent of the people who work in hospitals are women. In the private sector, in the domestic care sector, their share is even higher. It is a task for society as a whole to rethink this. This starts on a small scale, for example with parental leave. How many men take parental leave these days? There are still very few, even though more and more are doing so. There needs to be a change in thinking, and society needs to promote the idea that caregiving tasks are shared equally and that it is not the sole task of women to provide care. Men can do that just as well. If care work is always shifted onto women, this leads to women working part-time because they are still caring for relatives, for example. Then they automatically earn less than men – an endless spiral that we have to get out of.</p>\n<p><em>You are also fighting against the lack of autonomy at work and the hierarchical division of labor. What exactly does that mean and how would you like to organise work in care differently?</em></p>\n<p>I can report from my own experience at work. It’s often the case that it’s not us, but the doctors who decide what needs to be done. It often happens that the doctor intervenes in my profession more than is reasonable. That is a problem, because I have learned the nursing profession and I can and want to determine independently what is good for the patient from a nursing point of view. In German hospitals, however, it is not at all common, or only to a very limited extent, for nurses to have a say in treatments or in questions of care. Too often, the focus is primarily on medical issues that the doctor orders and the nurse is supposed to carry out. If we are to achieve a better appreciation of our profession, it must end with others telling me what to do. Of course we should work together with the doctors, and in many cases this works very well. But we don’t need these hierarchies.</p>\n<p>In many hospitals, there is still only a medical director and an administrative director. Where are the nursing staff? We are the largest professional group in the hospital. Many hospitals now also have a nursing directorate with equal rights, but not everywhere yet. That urgently needs to change. To do that, we as nurses have to become even more self-confident. We really have to stand up and fight for this; we have let this happen to us for far too long.</p>\n<p><em>Are such ‘marginal’ topics, which are very important for developing self-confidence in everyday life, topics that you also discuss in the current dispute?</em></p>\n<p>Yes, they are topics. That’s why this alliance exists. We started with the demand for more staff in the hospital, but in the meantime we have gone much, much further. This feminist perspective has become much broader and bigger, but so have many other issues. They’re not always all equally present, but we’re always trying to focus on new issues as well. For example, we have also started to network more closely with the climate movement, because there are many points of contact there as well.</p>\n<p><em>When you’re at a demonstration with 2,000 people, are there also sometimes nurses who carry a self-made sign that says, for example, “Abolition of the hierarchy” or something similar?</em></p>\n<p>Yes, there are. This is becoming increasingly important, especially among younger colleagues. At the moment, the main topic is the need for more staff, but precisely because it’s about better working conditions, other issues always play a role as well. For many colleagues, it is an important question how self-confident and independent they can be in their profession. If I work in a profession where I’m always controlled by others, then at some point I get fed up.</p>\n<p><em>From time to time, there are calls for hospitals to be taken back over by the local authorities, or the demand for ‘re-nationalisation’. Now we are dealing with public hospitals at Vivantes and Charité. Doesn’t the need to strike here, too, because working conditions are bad, make it clear that an even more radical change is needed – perhaps in the direction of a care revolution – in order to fight for a health care system based on solidarity?</em></p>\n<p>In municipal – public hospitals, one already earns better – in Berlin, you are only paid according to the better standards of the TVöD if you work at Vivantes and Charité. So although our working conditions are poor, they are still better than those of our colleagues in other hospitals. I think that remunicipalisation is the right way to go. At the very least, all clinics should be run by non-profit organisations. Private clinics should be abolished, as they are only interested in making a profit – especially the large hospital operators such as Asklepios and Helios. Of course, we can think about a revolution and whether we need a market economy at all. But for now, I’ll start on a small scale, with our struggles.</p>\n"}}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
